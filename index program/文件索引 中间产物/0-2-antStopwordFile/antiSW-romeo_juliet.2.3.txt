    |      iii. friar laurence's cell. 
 enter friar laurence,  a basket  friar laurence   grey-eyed morn smiles   frowning night, 
 chequering  eastern clouds  streaks  light, 
  flecked darkness  a drunkard reels 
   day's path  titan's fiery wheels: 
 now, ere  sun advance  burning eye, 
  day  cheer  night's dank dew  dry, 
   up-fill  osier cage   
  baleful weeds  precious-juiced flowers. 
  earth  nature's mother   tomb; 
    burying grave    womb, 
    womb children  divers kind 
  sucking   natural bosom find, 
    virtues excellent, 
        different. 
 o, mickle   powerful grace  lies 
  herbs, plants, stones,   true qualities: 
  nought  vile    earth doth live 
    earth  special good doth give, 
  aught  good  strain'd   fair  
 revolts  true birth, stumbling  abuse: 
 virtue  turns vice,  misapplied; 
  vice   action dignified. 
   infant rind   small flower 
 poison hath residence  medicine power: 
  this,  smelt,   part cheers  part; 
  tasted, slays  senses   heart. 
   opposed kings encamp   
      herbs, grace  rude will; 
    worser  predominant, 
 full   canker death eats   plant. 

 enter romeo  romeo  good morrow, father. 
 friar laurence  benedicite! 
  early tongue  sweet saluteth me? 
 young son,  argues a distemper'd head 
    bid good morrow  thy bed: 
 care   watch    man's eye, 
   care lodges, sleep   lie; 
   unbruised youth  unstuff'd brain 
 doth couch  limbs,  golden sleep doth reign: 
  thy earliness doth  assure 
 thou art up-roused   distemperature; 
    so,    hit  right, 
  romeo hath    bed to-night. 
 romeo     true;  sweeter rest  mine. 
 friar laurence  god pardon sin! wast thou  rosaline? 
 romeo   rosaline,  ghostly father? no; 
   forgot  name,   name's woe. 
 friar laurence    good son:   hast thou been, then? 
 romeo    thee, ere thou    again. 
    feasting   enemy, 
   a sudden  hath wounded me, 
    wounded:   remedies 
  thy   holy physic lies: 
  bear  hatred, blessed man, for, lo, 
  intercession  steads  foe. 
 friar laurence   plain, good son,  homely  thy drift; 
 riddling confession finds  riddling shrift. 
 romeo   plainly   heart's dear love  set 
   fair daughter  rich capulet: 
    hers,    set  mine; 
   combined, save  thou  combine 
  holy marriage:      
  met,  woo'd   exchange  vow, 
   thee   pass;    pray, 
  thou consent  marry  to-day. 
 friar laurence  holy saint francis,  a change  here! 
  rosaline,  thou didst love  dear, 
   forsaken? young men's love  lies 
     hearts,    eyes. 
 jesu maria,  a deal  brine 
 hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks  rosaline! 
   salt water thrown   waste, 
  season love,    doth  taste! 
  sun   thy sighs  heaven clears, 
 thy  groans ring    ancient ears; 
 lo,   thy cheek  stain doth sit 
    tear    wash'd  yet: 
  e'er thou wast thyself   woes thine, 
 thou   woes    rosaline: 
  art thou changed? pronounce  sentence then, 
 women  fall,    strength  men. 
 romeo  thou chid'st  oft  loving rosaline. 
 friar laurence   doting,   loving, pupil mine. 
 romeo   bad'st  bury love. 
 friar laurence    a grave, 
  lay  in,    have. 
 romeo   pray thee, chide not;    love  
 doth grace  grace  love  love allow; 
     so. 
 friar laurence  o,  knew  
 thy love  read  rote    spell. 
  come, young waverer, come,   me, 
   respect  thy assistant be; 
   alliance   happy prove, 
  turn  households' rancour  pure love. 
 romeo  o,   hence;  stand  sudden haste. 
 friar laurence  wisely  slow;  stumble  run fast.
