 enter cloten  cloten       place    meet,  
 pisanio  mapped  truly.  fit  garments 
 serve me!    mistress,     
     tailor,   fit too?

 a woman's fitness   fits.    
 play  workman.   speak   myself--for  
   vain-glory  a    glass  confer 
    chamber--i mean,  lines   body  
   drawn  his;   young,  strong, 
  beneath   fortunes,     
 advantage   time,    birth, alike 
 conversant  general services,   remarkable 
  single oppositions:   imperceiverant 
  loves    despite.  mortality is! 
 posthumus, thy head,    growing  thy 
 shoulders,    hour  off; thy 
 mistress enforced; thy garments cut  pieces

 testiness,  turn    commendations.  
 horse  tied  safe: out, sword,   a sore 
 purpose! fortune, put    hand!   
   description   meeting-place;  
  fellow dares  deceive me.
