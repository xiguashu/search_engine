  well-appointed king  hampton pier 
 embark  royalty;   brave fleet 
  silken streamers  young phoebus fanning: 
 play   fancies,    behold 
   hempen tackle ship-boys climbing; 
 hear  shrill whistle  doth order give 
  sounds confused; behold  threaden sails, 
 borne   invisible  creeping wind, 
 draw  huge bottoms   furrow'd sea, 
 breasting  lofty surge: o,    
  stand   ravage  behold 
 a city   inconstant billows dancing; 
   appears  fleet majestical, 
 holding due   harfleur. follow, follow:
