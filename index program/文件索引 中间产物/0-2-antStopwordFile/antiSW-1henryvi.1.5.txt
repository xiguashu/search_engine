   alarum again:  talbot pursueth   dauphin,  driveth him:  enter joan la  pucelle, driving englishmen  her,  exit    re-enter talbot  talbot     strength,  valour,   force? 
  english troops retire,   stay them: 
 a woman clad  armour chaseth them. 

 re-enter joan la pucelle  here,   comes.   a bout  thee; 
 devil  devil's dam,  conjure thee: 
 blood   draw  thee, thou art a witch, 
  straightway give thy soul   thou servest. 
 joan la pucelle  come, come, 'tis     disgrace thee. 

   fight  talbot  heavens,   suffer hell   prevail? 
  breast  burst  straining   courage 
    shoulders crack  arms asunder. 
    chastise  high-minded strumpet. 

  fight   joan la pucelle  talbot, farewell; thy hour    come: 
    victual orleans forthwith. 

 a short alarum;  enter  town  soldiers  o'ertake me,  thou canst;  scorn thy strength. 
 go, go, cheer  thy hungry-starved men; 
  salisbury    testament: 
  day  ours,     be. 

 exit  talbot   thoughts  whirled  a potter's wheel; 
      am,    do; 
 a witch,  fear,  force,  hannibal, 
 drives   troops  conquers   lists: 
  bees  smoke  doves  noisome stench 
    hives  houses driven away. 
  call'd    fierceness english dogs; 
 now,   whelps,  crying run away. 

 a short alarum  hark, countrymen!  renew  fight, 
  tear  lions   england's coat; 
 renounce  soil, give sheep  lions' stead: 
 sheep run    treacherous   wolf, 
  horse  oxen   leopard, 
   fly   oft-subdued slaves. 

 alarum.   skirmish     be: retire   trenches: 
   consented  salisbury's death, 
    strike a stroke   revenge. 
 pucelle  enter'd  orleans, 
  spite    aught    do. 
 o,     die  salisbury! 
  shame hereof    hide  head.
