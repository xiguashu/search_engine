sonnet cxxivsonnet cxxivif  dear love    child  state,
   fortune's bastard  unfather'd'
 subject  time's love   time's hate,
weeds  weeds,  flowers  flowers gather'd.
no,   builded   accident;
 suffers   smiling pomp,  falls
  blow  thralled discontent,
whereto  inviting time  fashion calls:
 fears  policy,  heretic,
 works  leases  short-number'd hours,
   stands hugely politic,
   grows  heat  drowns  showers.
   witness call  fools  time,
 die  goodness,   lived  crime.
