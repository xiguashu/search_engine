sonnet xixsonnet xixdevouring time, blunt thou  lion's paws,
   earth devour   sweet brood;
pluck  keen teeth   fierce tiger's jaws,
 burn  long-lived phoenix   blood;
 glad   seasons  thou fleets,
  whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed time,
  wide world    fading sweets;
  forbid thee   heinous crime:
o, carve   thy hours  love's fair brow,
 draw  lines   thine antique pen;
  thy  untainted  
 beauty's pattern  succeeding men.
yet,  thy worst,  time:  thy wrong,
 love    verse  live young.
