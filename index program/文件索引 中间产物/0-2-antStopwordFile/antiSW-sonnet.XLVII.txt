sonnet xlviisonnet xlviibetwixt  eye  heart a league  took,
  doth good turns    other:
   eye  famish'd  a look,
 heart  love  sighs  doth smother,
  love's picture   eye doth feast
   painted banquet bids  heart;
 time  eye   heart's guest
   thoughts  love doth share a part:
so,   thy picture   love,
thyself  art resent   me;
 thou     thoughts canst move,
         thee;
or,   sleep, thy picture   sight
awakes  heart  heart's  eye's delight.
