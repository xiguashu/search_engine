sonnet cxisonnet cxio,   sake    fortune chide,
 guilty goddess   harmful deeds,
      life provide
 public means  public manners breeds.
      receives a brand,
    nature  subdued
   works in,   dyer's hand:
pity       renew'd;
whilst,  a  patient,   drink
potions  eisel 'gainst  strong infection
 bitterness    bitter think,
 double penance,  correct correction.
pity  then, dear friend,   assure ye
   pity    cure me.
