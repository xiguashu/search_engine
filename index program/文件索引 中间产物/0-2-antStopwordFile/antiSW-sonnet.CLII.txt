sonnet cliisonnet cliiin loving thee thou know'st   forsworn,
 thou art  forsworn,   love swearing,
  thy bed-vow broke   faith torn,
 vowing  hate   love bearing.
    oaths' breach   accuse thee,
  break twenty?   perjured most;
   vows  oaths   misuse thee
   honest faith  thee  lost,
   sworn deep oaths  thy deep kindness,
oaths  thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
and,  enlighten thee, gave eyes  blindness,
   swear     see;
   sworn thee fair;  perjured i,
 swear   truth  foul a lie!
