sonnet cxxviiisonnet cxxviiihow oft,  thou,  music, music play'st,
  blessed wood  motion sounds
 thy sweet fingers,  thou gently sway'st
 wiry concord   ear confounds,
  envy  jacks  nimble leap
 kiss  tender   thy hand,
  poor lips,    harvest reap,
  wood's boldness  thee blushing stand!
   tickled,   change  state
 situation   dancing chips,
o'er  thy fingers walk  gentle gait,
making dead wood  blest  living lips.
 saucy jacks  happy   this,
give  thy fingers,  thy lips  kiss.
