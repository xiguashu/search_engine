       doth seek. 
 lend   flourish   gentle tongues,-- 
 fie, painted rhetoric! o,    not: 
    sale a seller's praise belongs,

 a wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,

 ferdinand  o paradox! black   badge  hell, 
  hue  dungeons   suit  night; 
  beauty's crest   heavens well. 
 biron  devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits  light. 
 o,   black  lady's brows  deck'd, 
  mourns  painting  usurping hair 
  ravish doters  a false aspect; 
     born   black fair. 
  favour turns  fashion   days, 
  native blood  counted painting now; 
   red,   avoid dispraise, 
 paints  black,  imitate  brow. 
 dumain       chimney-sweepers black. 
 longaville     time  colliers counted bright. 
 ferdinand   ethiopes   sweet complexion crack. 
 dumain  dark   candles now,  dark  light. 
 biron   mistresses     rain, 
  fear  colours   wash'd away. 
 ferdinand  'twere good,  did; for, sir,    plain,

 dumain  o, vile! then,   goes,  upward lies 
  street     walk'd overhead. 
 ferdinand     this?      love? 
 biron    sure;    forsworn. 
 ferdinand   leave  chat; and, good biron,  prove 
  loving lawful,   faith  torn. 
 dumain  ay, marry, there;  flattery   evil. 
 longaville  o,  authority   proceed; 
  tricks,  quillets,   cheat  devil. 
 dumain   salve  perjury. 
 biron  'tis   need. 
   you, then, affection's men  arms. 
      swear unto, 
  fast,  study,     woman; 
 flat treason 'gainst  kingly state  youth. 
 say,   fast?  stomachs   young; 
  abstinence engenders maladies. 
      vow'd  study, lords,

    you,  lord,  you,  you, 
    ground  study's excellence

  nimble spirits   arteries, 
  motion  long-during action tires 
  sinewy vigour   traveller. 
 now,     a woman's face, 
     forsworn    eyes

     author   world 
 teaches  beauty  a woman's eye? 
 learning    adjunct  ourself 
      learning  is: 
       ladies' eyes, 
       learning there? 
 o,    a vow  study, lords, 
    vow   forsworn  books. 
    you,  liege,  you,  you, 
  leaden contemplation    
  fiery numbers   prompting eyes 
  beauty's tutors  enrich'd  with? 
  slow arts    brain; 
  therefore, finding barren practisers, 
 scarce show a harvest   heavy toil: 
  love,  learned  a lady's eyes, 
 lives   immured   brain; 
 but,   motion   elements, 
 courses  swift  thought   power, 
     power a double power, 
   functions   offices. 
  adds a precious    eye; 
 a lover's eyes  gaze  eagle blind; 
 a lover's ear  hear  lowest sound, 
   suspicious head  theft  stopp'd: 
 love's feeling   soft   
    tender horns  cockl'd snails; 
 love's tongue proves dainty bacchus gross  taste: 
  valour,   love a hercules, 
  climbing trees   hesperides? 
 subtle  sphinx;  sweet  musical 
  bright apollo's lute, strung   hair: 
   love speaks,  voice    gods 
  heaven drowsy   harmony. 
  durst poet touch a pen  write 
   ink  temper'd  love's sighs; 
 o,   lines  ravish savage ears 
  plant  tyrants mild humility. 
  women's eyes  doctrine  derive: 
  sparkle    promethean fire; 
    books,  arts,  academes, 
  show,   nourish   world: 
       proves excellent. 
  fools    women  forswear, 
  keeping   sworn,   prove fools. 
  wisdom's sake, a word   men love, 
   love's sake, a word  loves  men, 
   men's sake,  authors   women, 
  women's sake,    men  men, 
    lose  oaths  find ourselves, 
    lose     oaths. 
   religion    forsworn, 
  charity  fulfills  law, 
    sever love  charity? 
 ferdinand  saint cupid, then! and, soldiers,   field! 
 biron  advance  standards,   them, lords; 
 pell-mell,   them!    advised, 
  conflict     sun  them. 
 longaville    plain-dealing; lay  glozes by: 
   resolve  woo  girls  france? 
 ferdinand   win  too:    devise 
  entertainment     tents. 
 biron  first,   park   conduct  thither; 
  homeward   attach  hand 
   fair mistress:   afternoon 
     strange pastime solace them, 
    shortness   time  shape; 
  revels, dances, masks  merry hours 
 forerun fair love, strewing    flowers. 
 ferdinand  away, away!  time   omitted 
   betime,      fitted. 
 biron  allons! allons! sow'd cockle reap'd  corn; 
  justice  whirls  equal measure: 
 light wenches  prove plagues  men forsworn; 
  so,  copper buys   treasure.
