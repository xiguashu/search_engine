    prologue   households,  alike  dignity, 
  fair verona,   lay  scene, 
  ancient grudge break   mutiny, 
  civil blood  civil hands unclean. 
    fatal loins    foes 
 a pair  star-cross'd lovers   life; 
  misadventured piteous overthrows 
    death bury  parents' strife. 
  fearful passage   death-mark'd love, 
   continuance   parents' rage, 
 which,   children's end, nought  remove, 
     hours' traffic   stage; 
      patient ears attend, 
    miss,  toil  strive  mend.
