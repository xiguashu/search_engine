sonnet xvisonnet xvibut wherefore    a mightier 
 war   bloody tyrant, time?
 fortify    decay
 means  blessed   barren rhyme?
 stand    top  happy hours,
  maiden gardens  unset
 virtuous   bear  living flowers,
 liker   painted counterfeit:
   lines  life  life repair,
 this, time's pencil,   pupil pen,
   worth  outward fair,
   live   eyes  men.
 give     still,
   live, drawn    sweet skill.
