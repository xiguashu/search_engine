 enter judges, senators  tribunes,  martius   quintus, bound, passing    place  execution; titus  before, pleading  titus andronicus  hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay! 
  pity   age,  youth  spent 
  dangerous wars,   securely slept; 
    blood  rome's great quarrel shed; 
    frosty nights    watch'd; 
    bitter tears,     
 filling  aged wrinkles   cheeks; 
  pitiful   condemned sons, 
  souls   corrupted  'tis thought. 
    twenty sons   wept, 
   died  honour's lofty bed. 

 lieth down;  judges,  & c., pass  him,  exeunt   these, these, tribunes,   dust  write 
  heart's deep languor   soul's sad tears: 
   tears stanch  earth's dry appetite; 
  sons' sweet blood    shame  blush. 
 o earth,   befriend thee   rain, 
   distil    ancient urns, 
  youthful april     showers: 
  summer's drought  drop  thee still; 
  winter  warm tears  melt  snow 
   eternal spring-time  thy face, 
  thou refuse  drink  dear sons' blood. 

 enter lucius,   sword drawn  o reverend tribunes! o gentle, aged men! 
 unbind  sons, reverse  doom  death; 
    say,   wept before, 
  tears   prevailing orators. 
 lucius  o noble father,  lament  vain: 
  tribunes hear  not;    by; 
   recount  sorrows  a stone. 
 titus andronicus  ah, lucius,  thy brothers   plead. 
 grave tribunes,    entreat  you,-- 
 lucius   gracious lord,  tribune hears  speak. 
 titus andronicus  why, tis  matter, man;    hear, 
    mark me,     mark, 
    pity me,  plead  must; 
     sorrows   stones; 
 who,    answer  distress, 
    sort      tribunes, 
      intercept  tale: 
    weep,  humbly   feet 
 receive  tears    weep  me; 
 and,    attired  grave weeds, 
 rome  afford  tribune   these. 
 a stone  soft  wax,--tribunes  hard  stones; 
 a stone  silent,  offendeth not, 
  tribunes   tongues doom men  death. 

 rises   wherefore stand'st thou  thy weapon drawn? 
 lucius   rescue   brothers   death: 
   attempt  judges  pronounced 
  everlasting doom  banishment. 
 titus andronicus  o happy man!   befriended thee. 
 why, foolish lucius, dost thou  perceive 
  rome   a wilderness  tigers?

    mine:  happy art thou, then, 
   devourers   banished!

 hath  thee handless  thy father's sight? 
  fool hath added water   sea, 
  brought a faggot  bright-burning troy? 
  grief    height  thou camest, 
    nilus,  disdaineth bounds. 
 give  a sword,  chop   hands too; 
    fought  rome,    vain; 
    nursed  woe,  feeding life; 
  bootless prayer    held up, 
    served   effectless use: 
    service  require   
        cut  other. 
 'tis well, lavinia,  thou hast  hands; 
  hands,   rome service,   vain.

 hath hurt      killed  dead: 
    stand    a rock 
 environed  a wilderness  sea, 
  marks  waxing tide grow wave  wave, 
 expecting    envious surge 
    brinish bowels swallow him.
