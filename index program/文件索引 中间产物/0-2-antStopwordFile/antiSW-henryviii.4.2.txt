 katharine  o griffith, sick  death!

   leave  burthen. reach a chair: 
 so; now, methinks,  feel a  ease. 
 didst thou   me, griffith,  thou led'st me, 
   great child  honour, cardinal wolsey,  dead? 
 griffith  yes, madam;     grace, 
    pain  suffer'd, gave  ear to't. 
 katharine  prithee, good griffith,     died: 
  well,  stepp'd  me, happily 
   example.

 arrested   york,  brought  forward, 
  a  sorely tainted,   answer, 
  fell sick suddenly,  grew  ill 
    sit  mule. 
 katharine  alas, poor man! 
 griffith   last,  easy roads,    leicester, 
 lodged   abbey;   reverend abbot, 
    covent, honourably received him;

   man, broken   storms  state, 
    lay  weary bones  ye;

   unbounded stomach,  ranking 
   princes;  that,  suggestion, 
 tied   kingdom: simony  fair-play; 
   opinion   law: i'  presence 
    untruths;    double 
    words  meaning:   never, 
    meant  ruin, pitiful: 
  promises were,    was, mighty; 
   performance,    now, nothing: 
    body   ill,  gave 
  clergy  example.

 men's evil manners live  brass;  virtues 
  write  water.     highness

  overthrow heap'd happiness  him; 
  then,    then,  felt himself, 
    blessedness   little: 
 and,  add greater honours   age 
    give him,  died fearing god.
