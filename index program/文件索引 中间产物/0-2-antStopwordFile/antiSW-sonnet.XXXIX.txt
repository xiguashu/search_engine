sonnet xxxixsonnet xxxixo,  thy worth  manners   sing,
 thou art    part  me?
    praise     bring?
   't      praise thee?
     divided live,
  dear love lose   single one,
   separation   give
 due  thee  thou deservest alone.
o absence,  a torment wouldst thou prove,
   thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
 entertain  time  thoughts  love,
 time  thoughts  sweetly doth deceive,
  thou teachest     twain,
 praising    doth  remain!
