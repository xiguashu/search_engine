    |      ix.  roman camp. 
 flourish. alarum. a retreat  sounded. flourish.  enter,   side, cominius   romans;    side, marcius,   arm  a scarf  cominius      thee o'er  thy day's work, 
 thou'ldst   thy deeds:   report  
  senators  mingle tears  smiles, 
  great patricians  attend  shrug, 
 i'   admire,  ladies   frighted, 
 and, gladly quaked, hear more;   
 dull tribunes, 
 that,   fusty plebeians, hate thine honours, 
     hearts '   gods 
  rome hath  a soldier.' 
  camest thou  a morsel   feast, 
  fully dined before. 

 enter titus lartius,   power,   pursuit  lartius  o general, 
    steed,   caparison: 
 hadst thou beheld-- 
 marcius  pray now,  more:  mother, 
   a charter  extol  blood, 
    praise  grieves me.    
    done;    can; induced 
    been;    country: 
     effected  good  
 hath overta'en  act. 
 cominius      
  grave   deserving; rome   
     own: 'twere a concealment 
 worse  a theft,    a traducement, 
  hide  doings;   silence that, 
 which,   spire  top  praises vouch'd, 
    modest: therefore,  beseech  
  sign    are,   reward 
    done--before  army hear me. 
 marcius     wounds  me,   smart 
  hear  remember'd. 
 cominius    not, 
    fester 'gainst ingratitude, 
  tent   death.    horses, 
 whereof   ta'en good  good store,   
  treasure   field achieved  city, 
  render   tenth,   ta'en forth, 
   common distribution,  
   choice. 
 marcius    you, general; 
     heart consent   
 a bribe  pay  sword:   refuse it; 
  stand   common part   
   beheld  doing. 

 a long flourish.   cry 'marcius! marcius!'  cast   caps  lances: cominius  lartius stand bare  marcius     instruments,   profane, 
  sound more!  drums  trumpets  
 i'  field prove flatterers,  courts  cities  
    false-faced soothing! 
  steel grows soft   parasite's silk, 
     a coverture   wars! 
  more,  say!      wash'd 
  nose  bled,  foil'd  debile wretch.-- 
 which,  note,     done,-- 
  shout   
  acclamations hyperbolical; 
    loved     dieted 
  praises sauced  lies. 
 cominius   modest  you; 
  cruel   good report  grateful 
    give  truly:   patience, 
  'gainst    incensed,  put you, 
    means  proper harm,  manacles, 
  reason safely  you. therefore,   known, 
   us,    world,  caius marcius 
 wears  war's garland:  token   which, 
  noble steed,    camp,  give him, 
    trim belonging;    time, 
      corioli, call him, 
    applause  clamour   host, 
 caius marcius coriolanus! bear 
  addition nobly ever! 

 flourish. trumpets sound,  drums    caius marcius coriolanus! 
 coriolanus     wash; 
    face  fair,   perceive 
   blush  no: howbeit,   you. 
    stride  steed,    times 
  undercrest  good addition 
   fairness   power. 
 cominius  so,   tent; 
 where, ere   repose us,   write 
  rome   success. you, titus lartius, 
   corioli back: send   rome 
  best,     articulate, 
    good  ours. 
 lartius   shall,  lord. 
 coriolanus   gods   mock me. i,   
 refused  princely gifts,  bound  beg 
   lord general. 
 cominius  take't; 'tis yours.  is't? 
 coriolanus    lay   corioli 
  a poor man's house;    kindly: 
  cried  me;    prisoner; 
   aufidius     view, 
  wrath o'erwhelm'd  pity:  request  
  give  poor host freedom. 
 cominius  o,  begg'd! 
    butcher   son,   
  free    wind. deliver him, titus. 
 lartius  marcius,  name? 
 coriolanus   jupiter! forgot. 
   weary; yea,  memory  tired. 
    wine here? 
 cominius      tent: 
  blood   visage dries; 'tis time 
    look'd to: come.
