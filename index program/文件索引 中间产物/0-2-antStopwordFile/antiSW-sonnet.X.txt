sonnet xsonnet xfor shame! deny  thou bear'st love  any,
  thyself art  unprovident.
grant,  thou wilt, thou art beloved  many,
  thou  lovest   evident;
 thou art  possess'd  murderous hate
 'gainst thyself thou stick'st   conspire.
seeking  beauteous roof  ruinate
  repair   thy chief desire.
o, change thy thought,    change  mind!
 hate  fairer lodged  gentle love?
be,  thy presence is, gracious  kind,
  thyself   kind-hearted prove:
 thee  self,  love  me,
 beauty   live  thine  thee.
