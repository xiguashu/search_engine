    |      ii.  house  antipholus  ephesus. 
 enter adriana  luciana  adriana  ah, luciana,   tempt thee so? 
 mightst thou perceive austerely   eye 
    plead  earnest? yea  no? 
 look'd   red  pale,  sad  merrily? 
  observation madest thou   case 
   heart's meteors tilting   face? 
 luciana    denied      right. 
 adriana   meant    none;    spite. 
 luciana   swore     a stranger here. 
 adriana   true  swore,   forsworn  were. 
 luciana   pleaded   you. 
 adriana     he? 
 luciana   love  begg'd    begg'd  me. 
 adriana    persuasion   tempt thy love? 
 luciana   words    honest suit  move. 
    praise  beauty,   speech. 
 adriana  didst speak  fair? 
 luciana   patience,  beseech. 
 adriana   cannot,    not, hold  still; 
  tongue,    heart,    will. 
   deformed, crooked,   sere, 
 ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere; 
 vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind; 
 stigmatical  making, worse  mind. 
 luciana     jealous    a one? 
  evil lost  wail'd    gone. 
 adriana  ah,        say, 
     others' eyes  worse. 
    nest  lapwing cries away: 
  heart prays  him,   tongue  curse. 

 enter dromio  syracuse  dromio  syracuse  here! go;  desk,  purse! sweet, now,  haste. 
 luciana   hast thou lost thy breath? 
 dromio  syracuse   running fast. 
 adriana    thy master, dromio?   well? 
 dromio  syracuse  no,   tartar limbo, worse  hell. 
 a devil   everlasting garment hath him; 
   hard heart  button'd   steel; 
 a fiend, a fury, pitiless  rough; 
 a wolf, nay, worse, a fellow   buff; 
 a back-friend, a shoulder-clapper,   
 countermands 
  passages  alleys, creeks  narrow lands; 
 a hound  runs counter   draws dryfoot well; 
     judgement carries poor souls  hell. 
 adriana  why, man,    matter? 
 dromio  syracuse       matter:   'rested   case. 
 adriana  what,   arrested?     suit. 
 dromio  syracuse       suit   arrested well; 
    a suit  buff  'rested him,    tell. 
   send him, mistress, redemption,  money   desk? 
 adriana   fetch it, sister. 

 exit luciana     at, 
  he, unknown  me,    debt. 
  me,   arrested  a band? 
 dromio  syracuse    a band,   a stronger thing; 
 a chain, a chain!    hear  ring? 
 adriana  what,  chain? 
 dromio  syracuse  no, no,  bell: 'tis time    gone: 
    ere  left him,    clock 
 strikes one. 
 adriana   hours  back!     hear. 
 dromio  syracuse  o, yes;   hour meet a sergeant, a' turns   
  fear. 
 adriana    time   debt!  fondly dost thou reason! 
 dromio  syracuse  time  a  bankrupt,  owes    
 worth,  season. 
 nay,  a thief too:    heard men  
  time  stealing   night  day? 
  time   debt  theft,  a sergeant   way, 
 hath   reason  turn   hour  a day? 

 re-enter luciana  a purse  adriana  go, dromio;   money, bear  straight; 
  bring thy master home immediately. 
 come, sister:   press'd   conceit-- 
 conceit,  comfort   injury.
