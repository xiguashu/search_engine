      share it? 
 octavius    thought him; 
    voice    prick'd  die, 
   black sentence  proscription. 
 antony  octavius,     days  you:

  levying powers:   straight  head: 
    alliance  combined, 
   friends made,  means stretch'd 
    presently  sit  council, 
  covert matters    disclosed, 
  open perils surest answered. 
 octavius     so:      stake, 
  bay'd    enemies; 
    smile    hearts,  fear, 
 millions  mischiefs.
