sonnet cxlixsonnet cxlixcanst thou, o cruel!   love thee not,
     thee partake?
     thee,   forgot
  myself,  tyrant,  thy sake?
 hateth thee    call  friend?
  frown'st thou    fawn upon?
nay,  thou lour'st  me,    spend
revenge    present moan?
 merit     respect,
   proud thy service  despise,
    doth worship thy defect,
commanded   motion  thine eyes?
but, love, hate on,     thy mind;
    thou lovest,    blind.
