 desdemona     	 love doth  approve him, 
    stubbornness,  cheques,  frowns-- 
 prithee, unpin me,--have grace  favour  them. 
 emilia    laid  sheets  bade    bed. 
 desdemona  all's one. good faith,  foolish   minds! 
    die  thee prithee, shroud  
      sheets. 
 emilia  come,   talk. 
 desdemona   mother  a maid call'd barbara: 
    love,    loved proved mad 
   forsake her:   a song  'willow;' 
    'twas,   express'd  fortune, 
   died singing it:  song to-night 
      mind;     do, 
    hang  head    side, 
  sing   poor barbara. prithee, dispatch. 
 emilia     fetch  night-gown? 
 desdemona  no, unpin  here. 
  lodovico  a proper man. 
 emilia  a  handsome man. 
 desdemona   speaks well. 
 emilia    a lady  venice   walked barefoot 
  palestine  a touch   nether lip. 
 desdemona  [singing]   poor soul sat sighing  a sycamore tree, 
 sing  a green willow: 
  hand   bosom,  head   knee, 
 sing willow, willow, willow: 
  fresh streams ran  her,  murmur'd  moans; 
 sing willow, willow, willow; 
  salt tears fell  her,  soften'd  stones; 
 lay  these:-- 

 singing  sing willow, willow, willow; 
 prithee, hie thee;   anon:-- 

 singing  sing  a green willow    garland. 
   blame him;  scorn  approve,- 
 nay,   next.--hark!  is't  knocks? 
 emilia    wind. 
 desdemona  [singing]   call'd  love false love;   
   then? 
 sing willow, willow, willow: 
   court moe women,  couch  moe men! 
 so,  thee gone; good night ate eyes  itch; 
 doth  bode weeping? 
 emilia  'tis    there. 
 desdemona    heard   so. o,  men,  men! 
 dost thou  conscience think,--tell me, emilia,-- 
    women  abuse  husbands 
   gross kind? 
 emilia     such,  question. 
 desdemona  wouldst thou   a deed    world? 
 emilia  why,   you? 
 desdemona  no,   heavenly light! 
 emilia       heavenly light; 
   do't   i'  dark. 
 desdemona  wouldst thou   a deed    world? 
 emilia   world's a huge thing:   a great price. 
  a small vice. 
 desdemona   troth,   thou wouldst not. 
 emilia   troth,    should;  undo't    
 done. marry,      a   a 
 joint-ring,   measures  lawn,   
 gowns, petticoats,  caps,   petty 
 exhibition;     world,--why,   
    husband a cuckold    a 
 monarch?   venture purgatory for't. 
 desdemona  beshrew me,      a wrong 
    world. 
 emilia    wrong   a wrong i'  world:  
   world   labour, tis a wrong   
  world,    quickly   right. 
 desdemona          woman. 
 emilia  yes, a dozen;      vantage   
 store  world  played for. 
        husbands' faults 
  wives  fall:    slack  duties, 
  pour  treasures  foreign laps, 
   break   peevish jealousies, 
 throwing restraint  us;    strike us, 
  scant     despite; 
 why,   galls,      grace, 
     revenge.  husbands  
  wives  sense  them:    smell 
    palates   sweet  sour, 
  husbands have.       
   change   others?   sport? 
    is:  doth affection breed it? 
    doth: is't frailty   errs? 
    too:     affections, 
 desires  sport,  frailty,  men have? 
      well:    know, 
  ills  do,  ills instruct  so. 
 desdemona  good night, good night: heaven    send, 
   pick bad  bad,   bad mend!
