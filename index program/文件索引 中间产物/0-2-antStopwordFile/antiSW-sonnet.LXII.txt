sonnet lxiisonnet lxiisin  self-love possesseth   eye
   soul     part;
   sin    remedy,
   grounded    heart.
methinks  face  gracious   mine,
 shape  true,  truth   account;
     worth  define,
      worths surmount.
   glass shows   indeed,
beated  chopp'd  tann'd antiquity,
  self-love  contrary  read;
  self-loving  iniquity.
'tis thee, myself,     praise,
painting  age  beauty  thy days.
