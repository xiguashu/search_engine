    |      iv.  plains  gascony. 
 enter somerset,   army; a captain  talbot's    somerset     late;   send  now: 
  expedition   york  talbot 
  rashly plotted:   general force 
   a sally    town 
  buckled with:  over-daring talbot 
 hath sullied   gloss   honour 
   unheedful, desperate, wild adventure: 
 york set    fight  die  shame, 
 that, talbot dead, great york  bear  name. 
 captain    sir william lucy,    
 set   o'ermatch'd forces   aid. 

 enter sir william lucy  somerset   now, sir william!    sent? 
 lucy  whither,  lord?  bought  sold lord talbot; 
 who, ring'd   bold adversity, 
 cries   noble york  somerset, 
  beat assailing death   weak legions: 
  whiles  honourable captain  
 drops bloody sweat   war-wearied limbs, 
 and,  advantage lingering,   rescue, 
 you,  false hopes,  trust  england's honour, 
   aloof  worthless emulation. 
    private discord   
  levied succors   lend  aid, 
  he, renowned noble gentleman, 
 yields   life  a world  odds: 
 orleans  bastard, charles, burgundy, 
 alencon, reignier, compass  about, 
  talbot perisheth   default. 
 somerset  york set  on; york     aid. 
 lucy   york  fast   grace exclaims; 
 swearing   withhold  levied host, 
 collected   expedition. 
 somerset  york lies;        horse; 
  owe   duty,   love; 
   foul scorn  fawn    sending. 
 lucy   fraud  england,   force  france, 
 hath  entrapp'd  noble-minded talbot: 
   england   bear  life; 
  dies, betray'd  fortune   strife. 
 somerset  come, go;   dispatch  horsemen straight: 
   hours      aid. 
 lucy   late  rescue:   ta'en  slain; 
  fly   not,     fled; 
  fly  talbot never,   might. 
 somerset     dead, brave talbot,  adieu! 
 lucy   fame lives   world,  shame  you.
