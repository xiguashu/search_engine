    henceforth   myself, 
 mighty    fear'd,   condition; 
  hath  smooth  oil, soft  young down, 
   lost  title  respect 
   proud soul ne'er pays    proud. 
 earl  worcester   house,  sovereign liege,  deserves 
  scourge  greatness     it; 
    greatness     hands 
  holp    portly. 
 northumberland   lord.--

   deliver'd   majesty: 
  envy, therefore,  misprison 
  guilty   fault    son. 
 hotspur   liege,   deny  prisoners. 
   remember,   fight  done, 
    dry  rage  extreme toil, 
 breathless  faint, leaning   sword, 
   a  lord, neat,  trimly dress'd, 
 fresh  a bridegroom;   chin  reap'd 
 show'd  a stubble-land  harvest-home; 
   perfumed  a milliner; 
  'twixt  finger   thumb  held 
 a pouncet-box,    anon 
  gave  nose  took't  again; 
  therewith angry,     there, 
    snuff;    smiled  talk'd, 
    soldiers bore dead bodies by, 
  call'd  untaught knaves, unmannerly, 
  bring a slovenly unhandsome corse 
 betwixt  wind   nobility. 
   holiday  lady terms 
  question'd me;   rest, demanded 
  prisoners   majesty's behalf. 
  then,  smarting   wounds  cold, 
    pester'd  a popinjay,

      not;     mad 
    shine  brisk  smell  sweet 
  talk   a waiting-gentlewoman 
  guns  drums  wounds,--god save  mark!-- 
  telling   sovereign'st   earth 
  parmaceti    bruise; 
     great pity,   was, 
  villanous salt-petre   digg'd 
    bowels   harmless earth, 
   a good tall fellow  destroy'd 
  cowardly;     vile guns, 
      a soldier. 
  bald unjointed chat  his,  lord, 
  answer'd indirectly,   said;

   proviso  exception, 
      charge  ransom straight 
  brother-in-law,  foolish mortimer; 
 who,   soul, hath wilfully betray'd

 hath  married.   coffers, then, 
  emptied  redeem a traitor home?

    fall off,  sovereign liege, 
    chance  war;  prove  true 
      tongue    wounds, 
  mouthed wounds,  valiantly   
    gentle severn's sedgy bank, 
  single opposition, hand  hand, 
   confound   part   hour 
  changing hardiment  great glendower: 
  times  breathed   times  
  drink, 
  agreement,  swift severn's flood; 
  then, affrighted   bloody looks, 
 ran fearfully   trembling reeds, 
  hid  crisp head   hollow bank, 
 bloodstained   valiant combatants. 
   base  rotten policy 
 colour  working   deadly wounds; 
    noble mortimer 
 receive  many,   willingly: 
      slander'd  revolt.

  durst    met  devil  
  owen glendower   enemy.

    urged  ransom   
   wife's brother,   cheek look'd pale, 
    face  turn'd  eye  death, 
 trembling      mortimer. 
 earl  worcester    blame him:    proclaim'd

  banish'd honours  restore  
   good thoughts   world again, 
 revenge  jeering  disdain'd contempt 
   proud king,  studies day  night 
  answer   debt  owes   
    bloody payment   deaths: 
 therefore,  say-- 
 earl  worcester  peace, cousin,   more: 
     unclasp a secret book, 
    quick-conceiving discontents 
  read  matter deep  dangerous, 
  full  peril  adventurous spirit

 send danger   east   west, 
  honour cross    north  south, 
    grapple: o,  blood  stirs 
  rouse a lion   start a hare! 
 northumberland  imagination   great exploit 
 drives    bounds  patience.

  pluck bright honour   pale-faced moon, 
  dive   bottom   deep, 
  fathom-line   touch  ground, 
  pluck  drowned honour   locks;

   'mortimer,'  give   
    anger   motion. 
 earl  worcester  hear you, cousin; a word. 
 hotspur   studies   solemnly defy, 
 save   gall  pinch  bolingbroke: 
    sword-and-buckler prince  wales, 
      father loves   
    glad  met   mischance, 
     poison'd  a pot  ale. 
 earl  worcester  farewell, kinsman:  talk

 tying thine ear   tongue  thine own! 
 hotspur  why,  you,   whipp'd  scourged  rods, 
 nettled  stung  pismires,   hear 
   vile politician, bolingbroke.

  secretly   bosom creep 
    noble prelate,  beloved, 
  archbishop.

 hotspur  why,   choose   a noble plot; 
    power  scotland   york, 
  join  mortimer, ha? 
 earl  worcester     shall. 
 hotspur   faith,   exceedingly  aim'd. 
 earl  worcester   'tis   reason bids  speed, 
  save  heads  raising  a head; 
 for, bear      can, 
  king       debt, 
      unsatisfied, 
   hath  a time  pay  home: 
      doth  
    strangers     love. 
 hotspur   does,  does:   revenged  him. 
 earl  worcester  cousin, farewell:      
    letters  direct  course. 
  time  ripe,    suddenly, 
  steal  glendower  lord mortimer; 
    douglas   powers  once, 
    fashion it,  happily meet, 
  bear  fortunes    strong arms, 
    hold   uncertainty. 
 northumberland  farewell, good brother:   thrive,  trust. 
 hotspur  uncle, adieu: o,   hours  short 
  fields  blows  groans applaud  sport!
