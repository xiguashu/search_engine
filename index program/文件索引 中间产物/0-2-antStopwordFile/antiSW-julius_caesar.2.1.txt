 o,       caesar's spirit, 
   dismember caesar! but, alas, 
 caesar  bleed  it! and, gentle friends, 
  kill  boldly,   wrathfully; 
  carve   a dish fit   gods, 
  hew   a carcass fit  hounds: 
    hearts,  subtle masters do, 
 stir   servants     rage, 
     chide 'em.    
  purpose    envious: 
   appearing   common eyes,

 lions  toils  men  flatterers; 
       hates flatterers, 
    does,    flattered.

    bring    capitol. 
 cassius  nay,         fetch him.

 cinna     uttermost,  fail  then. 
 metellus cimber  caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard, 
  rated   speaking   pompey:
