 king richard        well:  weep  joy 
  stand   kingdom  again. 
 dear earth,   salute thee   hand, 
  rebels wound thee   horses' hoofs: 
  a long-parted mother   child 
 plays fondly   tears  smiles  meeting, 
 so, weeping, smiling, greet  thee,  earth, 
   thee favours   royal hands. 
 feed  thy sovereign's foe,  gentle earth, 
   thy sweets comfort  ravenous sense; 
   thy spiders,  suck  thy venom, 
  heavy-gaited toads lie   way, 
  annoyance   treacherous feet 
   usurping steps  trample thee: 
 yield stinging nettles   enemies; 
     thy bosom pluck a flower, 
 guard it,  pray thee,  a lurking adder 
  double tongue   a mortal touch 
 throw death  thy sovereign's enemies. 
 mock   senseless conjuration, lords:

    thief,  traitor, bolingbroke, 
     hath revell'd   night 
    wandering   antipodes, 
    rising   throne,  east, 
  treasons  sit blushing   face, 
    endure  sight  day, 
  self-affrighted tremble   sin. 
    water   rough rude sea 
  wash  balm    anointed king; 
  breath  worldly men  depose 
  deputy elected   lord: 
     bolingbroke hath press'd 
  lift shrewd steel   golden crown,

 weak men  fall,  heaven  guards  right.

 o, call  yesterday, bid time return, 
  thou shalt  twelve thousand fighting men! 
 to-day, to-day, unhappy day,  late,

  worst  death,  death    day. 
 sir stephen scroop  glad     highness   arm'd 
  bear  tidings  calamity. 
   unseasonable stormy day, 
    silver rivers drown  shores, 
    world   dissolved  tears, 
  high   limits swells  rage 
  bolingbroke, covering  fearful land 
  hard bright steel  hearts harder  steel. 
 white-beards  arm'd  thin  hairless scalps 
  thy majesty; boys,  women's voices, 
 strive  speak big  clap  female joints 
  stiff unwieldy arms  thy crown: 
   beadsmen learn  bend  bows 
  double-fatal yew  thy state; 
 yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills 
  thy seat:  young   rebel, 
    worse    power  tell. 
 king richard    well,   thou tell'st a tale  ill.

  warrant    peace  bolingbroke. 
 sir stephen scroop  peace      indeed,  lord. 
 king richard   o villains, vipers, damn'd  redemption! 
 dogs, easily won  fawn   man! 
 snakes,   heart-blood warm'd,  sting  heart! 
  judases,   thrice worse  judas! 
    peace? terrible hell  war 
   spotted souls   offence!

  dust  paper   rainy eyes 
 write sorrow   bosom   earth, 
  choose executors  talk  wills: 
    so,     bequeath 
 save  deposed bodies   ground? 
  lands,  lives    bolingbroke's, 
     call    death 
   small model   barren earth 
  serves  paste  cover   bones. 
  god's sake,   sit   ground 
   sad stories   death  kings; 
     deposed;  slain  war, 
  haunted   ghosts   deposed; 
  poison'd   wives:  sleeping kill'd; 
  murder'd:    hollow crown 
  rounds  mortal temples  a king 
  death  court    antic sits, 
 scoffing  state  grinning   pomp, 
 allowing  a breath, a  scene, 
  monarchize,  fear'd  kill  looks, 
 infusing     vain conceit, 
    flesh  walls   life, 
  brass impregnable,  humour'd  
       a  pin 
 bores   castle wall,  farewell king! 
 cover  heads  mock  flesh  blood 
  solemn reverence: throw  respect, 
 tradition, form  ceremonious duty, 
     mistook    while: 
  live  bread  you, feel want, 
 taste grief,  friends: subjected thus, 
      me,   a king? 
 bishop  carlisle   lord, wise men ne'er sit  wail  woes, 
  presently prevent  ways  wail. 
  fear  foe,  fear oppresseth strength, 
    weakness strength   foe, 
    follies fight  yourself. 
 fear   slain;  worse    fight: 
  fight  die  death destroying death; 
  fearing dying pays death servile breath. 
 duke  aumerle   father hath a power; inquire   
  learn   a body  a limb. 
 king richard   thou chidest  well: proud bolingbroke,   
  change blows  thee   day  doom. 
  ague fit  fear  over-blown; 
  easy task    win  own. 
 say, scroop,  lies  uncle   power? 
 speak sweetly, man,  thy   sour. 
 sir stephen scroop  men judge   complexion   sky 
  state  inclination   day: 
      dull  heavy eye, 
  tongue hath  a heavier tale  say. 
  play  torturer,  small  small 
  lengthen   worst    spoken: 
  uncle york  join'd  bolingbroke, 
    northern castles yielded up, 
    southern gentlemen  arms 
   party. 
 king richard   thou hast  enough. 
 beshrew thee, cousin,  didst lead   

  duke  aumerle    sweet      despair! 
    now?  comfort   now? 
  heaven,  hate  everlastingly 
  bids    comfort  more. 
   flint castle:   pine away; 
 a king, woe's slave,  kingly woe obey. 
  power  have, discharge;     
  ear  land  hath  hope  grow, 
    none:    speak  
  alter this,  counsel   vain. 
 duke  aumerle   liege,  word. 
 king richard      double wrong 
  wounds    flatteries   tongue. 
 discharge  followers:    away, 
  richard's night  bolingbroke's fair day.
