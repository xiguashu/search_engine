    |      iii. juliet's chamber. 
 enter juliet  nurse  juliet  ay,  attires  best: but, gentle nurse, 
  pray thee, leave     to-night, 
       orisons 
  move  heavens  smile   state, 
 which,  thou know'st,  cross,  full  sin. 

 enter lady capulet  lady capulet  what,   busy, ho?    help? 
 juliet  no, madam;   cull'd  necessaries 
   behoveful   state to-morrow: 
   you,     left alone, 
    nurse  night sit   you; 
 for,   sure,    hands full all, 
    sudden business. 
 lady capulet  good night: 
  thee  bed,  rest;  thou hast need. 

 exeunt lady capulet  nurse  juliet  farewell! god     meet again. 
   a faint cold fear thrills   veins, 
   freezes   heat  life: 
  call     comfort me: 
 nurse!     here? 
  dismal      alone. 
 come, vial. 
    mixture   work  all? 
    married  to-morrow morning? 
 no, no:   forbid it: lie thou there. 

 laying   dagger      a poison,   friar 
 subtly hath minister'd    dead, 
    marriage    dishonour'd, 
   married    romeo? 
  fear  is:  yet, methinks,   not, 
   hath    a holy man. 
  if,    laid   tomb, 
  wake   time  romeo 
   redeem me?  a fearful point! 
   not, then,  stifled   vault, 
   foul mouth  healthsome air breathes in, 
   die strangled ere  romeo comes? 
 or,   live,     like, 
  horrible conceit  death  night, 
    terror   place,-- 
   a vault,  ancient receptacle, 
 where,     years,  bones 
    buried ancestors  packed: 
  bloody tybalt,   green  earth, 
 lies festering   shroud; where,   say, 
   hours   night spirits resort;-- 
 alack, alack,      i, 
  early waking,   loathsome smells, 
  shrieks  mandrakes' torn    earth, 
  living mortals, hearing them, run mad:-- 
 o,   wake,     distraught, 
 environed    hideous fears? 
  madly play   forefather's joints? 
  pluck  mangled tybalt   shroud? 
 and,   rage,   great kinsman's bone, 
   a club, dash   desperate brains? 
 o, look! methinks    cousin's ghost 
 seeking  romeo,   spit  body 
  a rapier's point: stay, tybalt, stay! 
 romeo,  come!    drink  thee.
