    |      ii. capulet's orchard. 
 enter juliet  juliet  gallop apace,  fiery-footed steeds, 
  phoebus' lodging:  a wagoner 
  phaethon  whip    west, 
  bring  cloudy night immediately. 
 spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, 
  runaway's eyes  wink  romeo 
 leap   arms, untalk'd   unseen. 
 lovers      amorous rites 
    beauties; or,  love  blind, 
   agrees  night. come, civil night, 
 thou sober-suited matron,   black, 
  learn    lose a winning match, 
 play'd  a pair  stainless maidenhoods: 
 hood  unmann'd blood, bating   cheeks, 
  thy black mantle;  strange love, grown bold, 
  true love acted simple modesty. 
 come, night; come, romeo; come, thou day  night; 
  thou wilt lie   wings  night 
 whiter   snow  a raven's back. 
 come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night, 
 give   romeo; and,    die, 
    cut     stars, 
      face  heaven  fine 
    world    love  night 
  pay  worship   garish sun. 
 o,   bought  mansion  a love, 
   possess'd it, and,    sold, 
   enjoy'd:  tedious   day 
    night   festival 
   impatient child  hath  robes 
    wear them. o,    nurse, 
   brings news;   tongue  speaks 
  romeo's  speaks heavenly eloquence. 

 enter nurse,  cords  now, nurse,  news?  hast thou there?  cords 
  romeo bid thee fetch? 
 nurse  ay, ay,  cords. 

 throws    juliet  ay me!  news?  dost thou wring thy hands? 
 nurse  ah, well-a-day!  dead,  dead,  dead! 
   undone, lady,   undone! 
 alack  day!  gone,  kill'd,  dead! 
 juliet   heaven   envious? 
 nurse  romeo can, 
  heaven cannot: o romeo, romeo! 
     thought it? romeo! 
 juliet   devil art thou,  dost torment  thus? 
  torture   roar'd  dismal hell. 
 hath romeo slain himself?  thou  'i,' 
   bare vowel 'i'  poison  
   death-darting eye  cockatrice: 
    i,      i; 
   eyes shut,   thee answer 'i.' 
    slain,  'i';   not, no: 
  sounds determine   weal  woe. 
 nurse     wound,      eyes,-- 
 god save  mark!--here   manly breast: 
 a piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse; 
 pale, pale  ashes,  bedaub'd  blood, 
   gore-blood;  swounded   sight. 
 juliet  o, break,  heart! poor bankrupt, break  once! 
  prison, eyes, ne'er   liberty! 
 vile earth,  earth resign;  motion here; 
  thou  romeo press  heavy bier! 
 nurse  o tybalt, tybalt,   friend  had! 
 o courteous tybalt! honest gentleman! 
     live   thee dead! 
 juliet   storm    blows  contrary? 
  romeo slaughter'd,   tybalt dead? 
  dear-loved cousin,   dearer lord? 
 then, dreadful trumpet, sound  general doom! 
    living,     gone? 
 nurse  tybalt  gone,  romeo banished; 
 romeo  kill'd him,   banished. 
 juliet  o god!  romeo's hand shed tybalt's blood? 
 nurse   did,  did; alas  day,  did! 
 juliet  o serpent heart, hid  a flowering face! 
   dragon   fair a cave? 
 beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical! 
 dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb! 
 despised substance  divinest show! 
     thou justly seem'st, 
 a damned saint,  honourable villain! 
 o nature,  hadst thou    hell, 
  thou didst bower  spirit  a fiend 
  moral paradise   sweet flesh? 
   book   vile matter 
   bound? o  deceit  dwell 
   a gorgeous palace! 
 nurse    trust, 
  faith,  honesty  men;  perjured, 
  forsworn,  naught,  dissemblers. 
 ah,   man? give   aqua vitae: 
  griefs,  woes,  sorrows   old. 
 shame   romeo! 
 juliet  blister'd  thy tongue 
   a wish!    born  shame: 
   brow shame  ashamed  sit; 
  'tis a throne  honour   crown'd 
 sole monarch   universal earth. 
 o,  a beast    chide  him! 
 nurse    speak     kill'd  cousin? 
 juliet    speak ill      husband? 
 ah, poor  lord,  tongue  smooth thy name, 
  i, thy three-hours wife,  mangled it? 
 but, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill  cousin? 
  villain cousin   kill'd  husband: 
 back, foolish tears,    native spring; 
  tributary drops belong  woe, 
  you, mistaking, offer   joy. 
  husband lives,  tybalt   slain; 
  tybalt's dead,    slain  husband: 
    comfort; wherefore weep  then? 
  word  was, worser  tybalt's death, 
  murder'd me:   forget  fain; 
 but, o,  presses   memory, 
  damned guilty deeds  sinners' minds: 
 'tybalt  dead,  romeo--banished;' 
  'banished,'   word 'banished,' 
 hath slain ten thousand tybalts. tybalt's death 
  woe enough,    ended there: 
 or,  sour woe delights  fellowship 
  needly   rank'd   griefs, 
  follow'd not,    'tybalt's dead,' 
 thy father,  thy mother, nay,  both, 
  modern lamentations   moved? 
   a rear-ward  tybalt's death, 
 'romeo  banished,'  speak  word, 
  father, mother, tybalt, romeo, juliet, 
  slain,  dead. 'romeo  banished!' 
    end,  limit, measure, bound, 
   word's death;  words   woe sound. 
    father,   mother, nurse? 
 nurse  weeping  wailing  tybalt's corse: 
     them?   bring  thither. 
 juliet  wash   wounds  tears:    spent, 
    dry,  romeo's banishment. 
    cords: poor ropes,   beguiled, 
    i;  romeo  exiled: 
     a highway   bed; 
  i, a maid, die maiden-widowed. 
 come, cords, come, nurse;    wedding-bed; 
  death,  romeo,   maidenhead! 
 nurse  hie   chamber:  find romeo 
  comfort you:  wot    is. 
 hark ye,  romeo     night: 
   him;   hid  laurence' cell. 
 juliet  o, find him! give  ring   true knight, 
  bid       farewell.
