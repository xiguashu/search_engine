sonnet lxxxixsonnet lxxxixsay  thou didst forsake    fault,
   comment   offence;
speak   lameness,   straight  halt,
 thy reasons making  defence.
thou canst not, love, disgrace    ill,
 set a form  desired change,
   disgrace: knowing thy will,
  acquaintance strangle   strange,
 absent  thy walks,    tongue
thy sweet beloved     dwell,
 i,   profane,    wrong
 haply    acquaintance tell.
 thee    vow debate,
   ne'er love   thou dost hate.
