sonnet cvsonnet cvlet   love  call'd idolatry,
  beloved   idol show,
  alike  songs  praises 
 one,  one,  such,   so.
kind   love to-day, to-morrow kind,
 constant  a wondrous excellence;
  verse  constancy confined,
  expressing, leaves  difference.
'fair, kind  true'    argument,
'fair, kind,  true' varying   words;
   change   invention spent,
 themes  one,  wondrous scope affords.
'fair, kind,  true,'   lived alone,
      seat  one.
