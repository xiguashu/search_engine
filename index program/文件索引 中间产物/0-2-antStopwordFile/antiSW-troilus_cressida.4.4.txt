    |      iv.  same. pandarus' house. 
 enter pandarus  cressida  pandarus   moderate,  moderate. 
 cressida       moderation? 
  grief  fine, full, perfect,   taste, 
  violenteth  a sense  strong 
    causeth it:    moderate it? 
    temporize   affection, 
  brew   a weak  colder palate, 
   allayment   give  grief. 
  love admits  qualifying dross; 
    grief,   a precious loss. 
 pandarus  here, here,   comes. 

 enter troilus  ah, sweet ducks! 
 cressida  o troilus! troilus! 

 embracing   pandarus   a pair  spectacles  here! 
   embrace too. 'o heart,'   goodly  is, 
 '--o heart, heavy heart, 
  sigh'st thou  breaking? 
   answers again, 
 ' thou canst  ease thy smart 
  friendship   speaking.' 
    a truer rhyme.   cast  
 nothing,    live      a 
 verse:   it,   it.  now, lambs? 
 troilus  cressid,  love thee   strain'd a purity, 
   bless'd gods,  angry   fancy, 
  bright  zeal   devotion  
 cold lips blow   deities,  thee  me. 
 cressida    gods envy? 
 pandarus  ay, ay, ay, ay; 'tis  plain a case. 
 cressida     true      troy? 
 troilus  a hateful truth. 
 cressida  what,   troilus too? 
 troilus   troy  troilus. 
 cressida    possible? 
 troilus   suddenly;  injury  chance 
 puts  leave-taking, justles roughly  
  time  pause, rudely beguiles  lips 
   rejoindure, forcibly prevents 
  lock'd embrasures, strangles  dear vows 
    birth    labouring breath: 
  two,     thousand sighs 
  buy  other,  poorly sell  
   rude brevity  discharge  one. 
 injurious time   a robber's haste 
 crams  rich thievery up,    how: 
   farewells   stars  heaven, 
  distinct breath  consign'd kisses  them, 
  fumbles   a lose adieu, 
  scants   a single famish'd kiss, 
 distasted   salt  broken tears. 
 aeneas  [within]   lord,   lady ready? 
 troilus  hark!   call'd:    genius  
 cries 'come'    instantly  die. 
 bid   patience;    anon. 
 pandarus     tears? rain,  lay  wind,  
  heart   blown    root. 

 exit  cressida       grecians? 
 troilus   remedy. 
 cressida  a woful cressid 'mongst  merry greeks! 
     again? 
 troilus  hear me,  love:  thou  true  heart,-- 
 cressida   true!  now!  wicked deem  this? 
 troilus  nay,    expostulation kindly, 
    parting  us: 
  speak  ' thou true,'  fearing thee, 
    throw  glove  death himself, 
    maculation  thy heart: 
  ' thou true,'  i,  fashion  
  sequent protestation;  thou true, 
     thee. 
 cressida  o,    exposed,  lord,  dangers 
  infinite  imminent!    true. 
 troilus    grow friend  danger. wear  sleeve. 
 cressida     glove.     you? 
 troilus    corrupt  grecian sentinels, 
  give thee nightly visitation. 
    true. 
 cressida  o heavens! ' true' again! 
 troilus  hear   speak it, love: 
  grecian youths  full  quality; 
  loving,  composed  gifts  nature, 
 flowing  swelling o'er  arts  exercise: 
  novelty  move,  parts  person, 
 alas, a kind  godly jealousy-- 
 which,  beseech you, call a virtuous sin-- 
   afeard. 
 cressida  o heavens!  love  not. 
 troilus  die  a villain, then! 
      call  faith  question 
     merit:   sing, 
  heel  high lavolt,  sweeten talk, 
  play  subtle games; fair virtues all, 
    grecians   prompt  pregnant: 
        grace   
  lurks a   dumb-discoursive devil 
  tempts  cunningly:    tempted. 
 cressida      will? 
 troilus  no. 
         not: 
     devils  ourselves, 
    tempt  frailty   powers, 
 presuming   changeful potency. 
 aeneas  [within]  nay, good  lord,-- 
 troilus  come, kiss;    part. 
 paris  [within]  brother troilus! 
 troilus  good brother,   hither; 
  bring aeneas   grecian  you. 
 cressida   lord,    true? 
 troilus  who, i? alas,    vice,  fault: 
 whiles  fish  craft  great opinion, 
   great truth catch mere simplicity; 
    cunning gild  copper crowns, 
  truth  plainness   wear  bare. 
 fear   truth:  moral   wit 
  'plain  true;'    reach  it. 

 enter aeneas, paris, antenor, deiphobus,  diomedes  welcome, sir diomed!    lady 
   antenor  deliver you:

     high-soaring o'er thy praises 
  thou unworthy   call'd  servant. 
  charge thee   well,    charge; 
 for,   dreadful pluto,  thou dost not, 
   great bulk achilles  thy guard,
