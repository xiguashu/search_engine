sonnet cxliiisonnet cxliiilo!  a careful housewife runs  catch
   feather'd creatures broke away,
sets   babe    swift dispatch
 pursuit       stay,
  neglected child holds   chase,
cries  catch   busy care  bent
 follow   flies   face,
 prizing  poor infant's discontent;
 runn'st thou    flies  thee,
  thy babe chase thee afar behind;
  thou catch thy hope, turn   me,
 play  mother's part, kiss me,  kind:
   pray  thou mayst  thy 'will,'
 thou turn back,   loud crying still.
