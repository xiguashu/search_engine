 ' meat doth burn,' quoth i; ' gold!' quoth he: 
 '   home?' quoth i; ' gold!' quoth he. 
 '   thousand marks  gave thee, villain?' 
 ' pig,' quoth i, ' burn'd;' ' gold!' quoth he:

 adriana   company    minions grace, 
    home starve  a merry look. 
 hath homely age  alluring beauty  
   poor cheek?   hath wasted it: 
   discourses dull? barren  wit? 
  voluble  sharp discourse  marr'd, 
 unkindness blunts    marble hard: 
   gay vestments  affections bait? 
    fault:  master   state: 
  ruins       found, 
    ruin'd?     ground 
   defeatures.  decayed fair

   alone,    detain, 
     fair quarter   bed! 
    jewel  enamelled

   touch,   touching  
 wear gold:     hath a name, 
  falsehood  corruption doth  shame. 
    beauty    eye, 
  weep  left away,  weeping die. 
 luciana    fond fools serve mad jealousy!
