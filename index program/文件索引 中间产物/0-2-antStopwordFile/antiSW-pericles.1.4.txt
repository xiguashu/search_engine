    |      iv. tarsus. a room   governor's house. 
 enter cleon,  governor  tarsus,  dionyza,    cleon   dionyza,   rest  here, 
   relating tales  others' griefs, 
   'twill teach   forget  own? 
 dionyza     blow  fire  hope  quench it; 
   digs hills    aspire 
 throws   mountain  cast  a higher. 
 o  distressed lord,    griefs are; 
    felt,    mischief's eyes, 
    groves,  topp'd,  higher rise. 
 cleon  o dionyza, 
  wanteth food,       it, 
   conceal  hunger   famish? 
  tongues  sorrows  sound deep 
  woes   air;  eyes  weep, 
  tongues fetch breath   proclaim  louder; 
 that,  heaven slumber   creatures want, 
   awake  helps  comfort them. 
   discourse  woes, felt  years, 
  wanting breath  speak    tears. 
 dionyza     best, sir. 
 cleon   tarsus, o'er     government, 
 a city   plenty held full hand, 
  riches strew'd     streets; 
  towers bore heads  high  kiss'd  clouds, 
  strangers ne'er beheld  wondered at; 
  men  dames  jetted  adorn'd, 
   another's glass  trim  by: 
  tables  stored full,  glad  sight, 
      feed   delight; 
  poverty  scorn'd,  pride  great, 
     grew odious  repeat. 
 dionyza  o, 'tis  true. 
 cleon     heaven  do!    change, 
  mouths,    late, earth, sea,  air, 
      content  please, 
   gave  creatures  abundance, 
  houses  defiled    use, 
    starved    exercise: 
  palates who,    summers younger, 
   inventions  delight  taste, 
    glad  bread,  beg  it: 
  mothers who,  nousle   babes, 
 thought nought  curious,  ready  
  eat   darlings   loved. 
  sharp  hunger's teeth,    wife 
 draw lots    die  lengthen life: 
  stands a lord,   a lady weeping; 
   sink,      fall 
  scarce strength left  give  burial. 
    true? 
 dionyza   cheeks  hollow eyes  witness it. 
 cleon  o,   cities   plenty's cup 
   prosperities  largely taste, 
   superfluous riots, hear  tears! 
  misery  tarsus   theirs. 

 enter a lord  lord    lord governor? 
 cleon  here. 
 speak  thy sorrows  thou bring'st  haste, 
  comfort       expect. 
 lord    descried,   neighbouring shore, 
 a portly sail  ships  hitherward. 
 cleon   thought  much. 
  sorrow    brings  heir, 
   succeed   inheritor; 
    ours:  neighbouring nation, 
  advantage   misery, 
 hath stuff'd  hollow vessels   power, 
  beat  down,     already; 
   a conquest  unhappy me, 
   glory's   overcome. 
 lord     fear; for,   semblance 
   white flags display'd,  bring  peace, 
      favourers,   foes. 
 cleon  thou speak'st  him's untutor'd  repeat: 
    fairest show means  deceit. 
  bring        can, 
    fear? 
  ground's  lowest,      there. 
    general  attend  here, 
      comes,    comes, 
    craves.

    ships  number   men 
   a beacon fired  amaze  eyes. 
   heard  miseries    tyre, 
    desolation   streets: 
     add sorrow   tears, 
   relieve    heavy load; 
    ships,  happily   
    trojan horse  stuff'd  
  bloody veins, expecting overthrow, 
  stored  corn    needy bread, 
  give  life  hunger starved  dead. 
    gods  greece protect you! 
   pray  you. 
 pericles  arise,  pray you, rise: 
      reverence,   love, 
  harbourage  ourself,  ships,  men. 
 cleon        gratify, 
  pay   unthankfulness  thought, 
    wives,  children,  ourselves, 
  curse  heaven  men succeed  evils! 
  when,--the   hope  ne'er  seen,-- 
  grace     town  us. 
 pericles     accept; feast  awhile, 
   stars  frown lend  a smile. 

 exeunt 
 enter gower  gower      a mighty king 
  child,  wis,  incest bring; 
 a  prince  benign lord, 
   prove awful   deed  word. 
  quiet   men  be, 
   hath pass'd necessity. 
  show    troubles reign, 
 losing a mite, a mountain gain. 
  good  conversation, 
    give  benison, 
    tarsus,    
 thinks   writ  speken can; 
 and,  remember   does, 
 build  statue    glorious: 
  tidings   contrary 
  brought  eyes;   speak i? 
 dumb show. 

 enter   door pericles talking  cleon;    train  them. enter   door a  gentleman,  a letter  pericles; pericles  shows  letter  cleon;   messenger a  reward,  knights him. exit pericles   door,  cleon    good helicane,  stay'd  home, 
   eat honey  a drone 
  others' labours;    strive 
  killen bad,  good alive; 
   fulfil  prince' desire, 
 sends word    haps  tyre: 
  thaliard  full bent  sin 
   intent  murder him; 
    tarsus    
 longer      rest. 
 he,  so, put   seas, 
   men been,  seldom ease; 
    wind begins  blow; 
 thunder   deeps  
   unquiet,   ship 
  house  safe  wreck'd  split; 
  he, good prince,   lost, 
  waves  coast  coast  tost: 
  perishen  man,  pelf, 
 ne aught escapen  himself; 
  fortune, tired   bad, 
 threw  ashore,  give  glad: 
    comes.    next, 
 pardon  gower,--this longs  text.
