sonnet cxxvisonnet cxxvio thou,  lovely boy,   thy power
dost hold time's fickle glass,  sickle, hour;
 hast  waning grown,   show'st
thy lovers withering  thy sweet  grow'st;
 nature, sovereign mistress  wrack,
 thou goest onwards,   pluck thee back,
  thee   purpose,   skill
 time disgrace  wretched minutes kill.
 fear her, o thou minion   pleasure!
  detain,    keep,  treasure:
 audit,  delay'd, answer'd  be,
  quietus   render thee.
