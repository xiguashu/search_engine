sonnet xxxisonnet xxxithy bosom  endeared   hearts,
   lacking  supposed dead,
  reigns love   love's loving parts,
   friends   thought buried.
  a holy  obsequious tear
hath dear religious love stol'n   eye
 interest   dead,   
  removed  hidden  thee lie!
thou art  grave  buried love doth live,
hung   trophies   lovers gone,
   parts    thee  give;
 due     thine alone:
 images  loved  view  thee,
 thou,  they, hast     me.
