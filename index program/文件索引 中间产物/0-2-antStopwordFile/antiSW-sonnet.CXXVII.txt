sonnet cxxviisonnet cxxviiin   age black   counted fair,
   were,  bore  beauty's name;
   black beauty's successive heir,
 beauty slander'd  a bastard shame:
   hand hath put  nature's power,
fairing  foul  art's false borrow'd face,
sweet beauty hath  name,  holy bower,
  profaned,   lives  disgrace.
  mistress' brows  raven black,
 eyes  suited,   mourners 
  who,  born fair,  beauty lack,
slandering creation  a false esteem:
   mourn,    woe,
  tongue  beauty   so.
