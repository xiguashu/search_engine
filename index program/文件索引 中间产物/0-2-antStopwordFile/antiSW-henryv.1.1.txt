    |      i. london.  ante-chamber   king's palace. 
 enter  archbishop  canterbury,   bishop  ely  canterbury   lord,   you;   bill  urged, 
    eleventh year    king's reign 
  like,      pass'd, 
    scambling  unquiet time 
  push     question. 
 ely   how,  lord,   resist  now? 
 canterbury     thought on.   pass  us, 
  lose      possession: 
    temporal lands  men devout 
  testament     church 
   strip  us;  valued thus: 
     maintain,   king's honour, 
 full fifteen earls  fifteen  knights, 
  thousand    good esquires; 
 and,  relief  lazars  weak age, 
  indigent faint souls  corporal toil. 
 a  almshouses   supplied; 
    coffers   king beside, 
 a thousand pounds   year:  runs  bill. 
 ely    drink deep. 
 canterbury  'twould drink  cup  all. 
 ely    prevention? 
 canterbury   king  full  grace  fair regard. 
 ely   a true lover   holy church. 
 canterbury   courses   youth promised  not. 
  breath  sooner left  father's body, 
    wildness, mortified  him, 
 seem'd  die too; yea,    moment 
 consideration,   angel,  
  whipp'd  offending adam   him, 
 leaving  body  a paradise, 
  envelop   celestial spirits. 
    a sudden scholar made; 
   reformation  a flood, 
   a heady currance, scouring faults 
   hydra-headed wilfulness 
    lose  seat     
    king. 
 ely    blessed   change. 
 canterbury  hear   reason  divinity, 
  all-admiring     
   desire  king   a prelate: 
 hear  debate  commonwealth affairs, 
     hath      study: 
 list  discourse  war,    hear 
 a fearful battle render'd   music: 
 turn      policy, 
  gordian knot     unloose, 
 familiar   garter: that,   speaks, 
  air, a charter'd libertine,  still, 
   mute  lurketh  men's ears, 
  steal  sweet  honey'd sentences; 
    art  practic part  life 
    mistress   theoric: 
   a    grace  glean it, 
   addiction   courses vain, 
  companies unletter'd, rude  shallow, 
  hours fill'd   riots, banquets, sports, 
   noted    study, 
  retirement,  sequestration 
  open haunts  popularity. 
 ely   strawberry grows   nettle 
  wholesome berries thrive  ripen  
 neighbour'd  fruit  baser quality: 
    prince obscured  contemplation 
   veil  wildness; which,  doubt, 
 grew   summer grass, fastest  night, 
 unseen,  crescive   faculty. 
 canterbury     so;  miracles  ceased; 
      admit  means 
    perfected. 
 ely  but,  good lord, 
    mitigation   bill 
 urged   commons? doth  majesty 
 incline  it,  no? 
 canterbury    indifferent, 
   swaying    part 
  cherishing  exhibiters  us; 
      offer   majesty, 
   spiritual convocation 
   regard     hand, 
    open'd   grace  large, 
  touching france,  give a greater sum 
     time  clergy  
    predecessors part withal. 
 ely     offer  received,  lord? 
 canterbury   good acceptance   majesty; 
 save     time   hear, 
   perceived  grace  fain  done, 
  severals  unhidden passages 
   true titles    dukedoms 
  generally   crown  seat  france 
 derived  edward,  great-grandfather. 
 ely     impediment  broke  off? 
 canterbury   french ambassador   instant 
 craved audience;   hour,  think,   
  give  hearing:    o'clock? 
 ely   is. 
 canterbury     in,    embassy; 
     a ready guess declare, 
   frenchman speak a word  it. 
 ely   wait  you,   long  hear it.
