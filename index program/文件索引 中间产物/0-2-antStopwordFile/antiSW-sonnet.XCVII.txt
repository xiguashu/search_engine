sonnet xcviisonnet xcviihow  a winter hath  absence 
 thee,  pleasure   fleeting year!
 freezings   felt,  dark days seen!
  december's bareness  where!
   time removed  summer's time,
 teeming autumn, big  rich increase,
bearing  wanton burden   prime,
 widow'd wombs   lords' decease:
  abundant issue seem'd  
 hope  orphans  unfather'd fruit;
 summer   pleasures wait  thee,
and, thou away,   birds  mute;
or,   sing, 'tis   dull a cheer
 leaves  pale, dreading  winter's near.
