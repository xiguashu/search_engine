  a new-crowned monarch:    
    dulcet sounds  break  day 
  creep   dreaming bridegroom's ear, 
  summon   marriage.   goes, 
    presence,     love, 
  young alcides,    redeem

  stairs  sand, wear    chins 
  beards  hercules  frowning mars; 
 who,  search'd,  livers white  milk; 
   assume  valour's excrement 
  render  redoubted!   beauty, 
     'tis purchased   weight; 
   works a miracle  nature, 
 making  lightest  wear   it: 
    crisped snaky golden locks 
    wanton gambols   wind, 
  supposed fairness,   
    dowry  a  head, 
  skull  bred    sepulchre. 
  ornament    guiled shore 
  a  dangerous sea;  beauteous scarf 
 veiling  indian beauty;  a word, 
   truth  cunning times put  
  entrap  wisest. therefore, thou gaudy gold, 
 hard food  midas,     thee; 
    thee, thou pale  common drudge 
 'tween   man:  thou, thou meagre lead, 
   threatenest  dost promise aught, 
 thy paleness moves    eloquence; 
   choose i; joy   consequence!
