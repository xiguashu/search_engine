    |      iv. rome. octavius caesar's house. 
 enter octavius caesar, reading a letter, lepidus,   train  octavius caesar    see, lepidus,  henceforth know, 
    caesar's natural vice  hate 
  great competitor:  alexandria 
    news:  fishes, drinks,  wastes 
  lamps  night  revel;    man-like 
  cleopatra;   queen  ptolemy 
  womanly  he;  gave audience,  
 vouchsafed     partners:   find  
 a     abstract   faults 
   men follow. 
 lepidus        
 evils enow  darken   goodness: 
  faults      spots  heaven, 
  fiery  night's blackness; hereditary, 
   purchased;    change, 
    chooses. 
 octavius caesar     indulgent.   grant,    
 amiss  tumble   bed  ptolemy; 
  give a kingdom  a mirth;  sit 
    turn  tippling  a slave; 
  reel  streets  noon,  stand  buffet 
  knaves  smell  sweat:   
  him,-- 
   composure   rare  
     blemish,--yet  antony 
   excuse  soils,    bear 
  great weight   lightness.   fill'd 
  vacancy   voluptuousness, 
 full surfeits,   dryness   bones, 
 call   for't:   confound  time, 
  drums    sport,  speaks  loud 
    state  ours,--'tis   chid 
   rate boys, who,  mature  knowledge, 
 pawn  experience   present pleasure, 
   rebel  judgment. 

 enter a messenger  lepidus    news. 
 messenger  thy biddings   done;   hour, 
  noble caesar, shalt thou  report 
  'tis abroad. pompey  strong  sea; 
   appears   beloved   
    fear'd caesar:   ports 
  discontents repair,  men's reports 
 give   wrong'd. 
 octavius caesar       less. 
  hath  taught    primal state, 
      wish'd   were; 
   ebb'd man, ne'er loved  ne'er worth love, 
  dear'd   lack'd.  common body, 
   a vagabond flag   stream, 
    back, lackeying  varying tide, 
  rot   motion. 
 messenger  caesar,  bring thee word, 
 menecrates  menas, famous pirates, 
   sea serve them,   ear  wound 
  keels   kind:  hot inroads 
    italy;  borders maritime 
 lack blood   on't,  flush youth revolt: 
  vessel  peep forth,  'tis   
   seen;  pompey's  strikes  
    war resisted. 
 octavius caesar  antony, 
 leave thy lascivious wassails.  thou  
 wast beaten  modena,  thou slew'st 
 hirtius  pansa, consuls,  thy heel 
  famine follow;  thou fought'st against, 
  daintily brought up,  patience  
  savages  suffer: thou didst drink 
  stale  horses,   gilded puddle 
  beasts  cough at: thy palate   deign 
  roughest berry   rudest hedge; 
 yea,   stag,  snow  pasture sheets, 
  barks  trees thou browsed'st;   alps 
   reported thou didst eat strange flesh, 
    die   on:   this-- 
  wounds thine honour   speak  now-- 
  borne   a soldier,  thy cheek 
    lank'd not. 
 lepidus  'tis pity  him. 
 octavius caesar    shames quickly 
 drive   rome: 'tis time  twain 
  show  i'  field;     
 assemble   council: pompey 
 thrives   idleness. 
 lepidus  to-morrow, caesar, 
    furnish'd  inform  rightly 
    sea  land     
  front  present time. 
 octavius caesar    encounter, 
    business too. farewell. 
 lepidus  farewell,  lord:      
  stirs abroad,   beseech you, sir, 
     partaker. 
 octavius caesar  doubt not, sir; 
  knew    bond.
