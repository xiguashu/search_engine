 enter leontes, cleomenes, dion, paulina,  servants  cleomenes  sir,    enough,   perform'd 
 a saint-like sorrow:  fault   make, 
     redeem'd; indeed, paid  
  penitence   trespass:   last, 
    heavens  done, forget  evil; 
   forgive yourself. 
 leontes    remember 
    virtues,   forget 
  blemishes  them,      
  wrong   myself;    much, 
  heirless  hath   kingdom  
 destroy'd  sweet'st companion  e'er  
 bred  hopes  of. 
 paulina  true,  true,  lord: 
 if,   one,  wedded   world, 
         good, 
   a perfect woman,   kill'd 
   unparallel'd. 
 leontes    so. kill'd! 
   kill'd!   so:  thou strikest  
 sorely,    did;    bitter 
  thy tongue    thought: now, good now, 
    seldom. 
 cleomenes    all, good lady: 
    spoken a thousand    
    time  benefit  graced 
  kindness better. 
 paulina       
    wed again. 
 dion      so,

    sovereign name;   
  dangers,   highness' fail  issue,

  holier than,  royalty's repair, 
  present comfort   future good, 
  bless  bed  majesty  
  a sweet fellow to't? 
 paulina     worthy, 
 respecting   gone. besides,  gods 
   fulfill'd  secret purposes; 
     divine apollo said, 
 is't   tenor   oracle, 
  king leontes     heir 
   lost child  found?    shall, 
    monstrous   human reason 
   antigonus  break  grave 
     me; who,   life, 
  perish   infant. 'tis  counsel 
  lord    heavens  contrary, 
 oppose   wills. 

  leontes  care   issue; 
  crown  find  heir: great alexander

      best. 
 leontes  good paulina, 
  hast  memory  hermione,

   used,    sainted spirit 
  possess  corpse,    stage, 
   offenders now,  soul-vex'd, 
  begin, '  me?' 
 paulina     power, 
    cause. 
 leontes   had;   incense  
  murder   married. 
 paulina    so. 
    ghost  walk'd, i'ld bid  mark 
  eye,      dull part in't 
  chose her;  i'ld shriek,    ears 
  rift  hear me;   words  follow'd 
   'remember mine.' 
 leontes  stars, stars, 
   eyes  dead coals! fear thou  wife; 
    wife, paulina. 
 paulina    swear 
   marry    free leave? 
 leontes  never, paulina;   blest  spirit! 
 paulina  then, good  lords, bear witness   oath. 
 cleomenes   tempt  over-much.

      a better. 
 gentleman  pardon, madam: 
      forgot,--your pardon,-- 
  other,    obtain'd  eye, 
    tongue too.   a creature, 
    a sect,  quench  zeal
