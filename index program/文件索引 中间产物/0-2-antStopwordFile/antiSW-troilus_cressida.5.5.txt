 enter diomedes  a servant  diomedes  go, go,  servant,  thou troilus' horse; 
 present  fair steed   lady cressid:

    knight  proof. 
 servant   go,  lord.

 enter agamemnon  agamemnon  renew, renew!  fierce polydamas 
 hath beat  menon: bastard margarelon 
 hath doreus prisoner, 
  stands colossus-wise, waving  beam, 
   pashed corses   kings 
 epistrophus  cedius: polyxenes  slain, 
 amphimachus  thoas deadly hurt, 
 patroclus ta'en  slain,  palamedes 
 sore hurt  bruised:  dreadful sagittary 
 appals  numbers: haste we, diomed, 
  reinforcement,   perish all. 

 enter nestor  nestor  go, bear patroclus' body  achilles; 
  bid  snail-paced ajax arm  shame. 
   a thousand hectors   field: 
    fights  galathe  horse, 
   lacks work; anon   afoot, 
    fly  die,  scaled sculls 
   belching whale;    yonder, 
    strawy greeks, ripe   edge, 
 fall   him,   mower's swath: 
 here, there,   where,  leaves  takes, 
 dexterity  obeying appetite 
      does,     
  proof  call'd impossibility. 

 enter ulysses  ulysses  o, courage, courage, princes! great achilles 
  arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance: 
 patroclus' wounds  roused  drowsy blood, 
    mangled myrmidons, 
  noseless, handless, hack'd  chipp'd,   him, 
 crying  hector. ajax hath lost a friend 
  foams  mouth,    arm'd   it, 
 roaring  troilus,  hath  to-day 
 mad  fantastic execution, 
 engaging  redeeming   
   a careless force  forceless care 
    luck,   spite  cunning, 
 bade  win all. 

 enter ajax  ajax  troilus! thou coward troilus!

 nestor  so, so,  draw together. 

 enter achilles  achilles     hector? 
 come, come, thou boy-queller, show thy face; 
      meet achilles angry: 
 hector?  hector?     hector.
