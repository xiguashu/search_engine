    |     prologue 
 enter chorus  chorus   entertain conjecture  a time 
  creeping murmur   poring dark 
 fills  wide vessel   universe. 
  camp  camp   foul womb  night 
  hum   army stilly sounds, 
   fixed sentinels  receive 
  secret whispers   other's watch: 
 fire answers fire,    paly flames 
  battle sees  other's umber'd face; 
 steed threatens steed,  high  boastful neighs 
 piercing  night's dull ear,    tents 
  armourers, accomplishing  knights, 
  busy hammers closing rivets up, 
 give dreadful note  preparation: 
  country cocks  crow,  clocks  toll, 
    hour  drowsy morning name. 
 proud   numbers  secure  soul, 
  confident  over-lusty french 
   low-rated english play  dice; 
  chide  cripple tardy-gaited night 
 who,  a foul  ugly witch, doth limp 
  tediously away.  poor condemned english, 
  sacrifices,   watchful fires 
 sit patiently  inly ruminate 
  morning's danger,   gesture sad 
 investing lank-lean; cheeks  war-worn coats 
 presenteth    gazing moon 
   horrid ghosts. o now,   behold 
  royal captain   ruin'd band 
 walking  watch  watch,  tent  tent, 
   cry 'praise  glory   head!' 
      visits   host. 
 bids  good morrow  a modest smile 
  calls  brothers, friends  countrymen. 
   royal face    note 
  dread  army hath enrounded him; 
  doth  dedicate  jot  colour 
   weary  all-watched night, 
  freshly   over-bears attaint 
  cheerful semblance  sweet majesty; 
   wretch, pining  pale before, 
 beholding him, plucks comfort   looks: 
 a largess universal   sun 
  liberal eye doth give   one, 
 thawing cold fear,    gentle all, 
 behold,   unworthiness define, 
 a  touch  harry   night. 
        battle fly; 
 where--o  pity!--we   disgrace 
      vile  ragged foils, 
  ill-disposed  brawl ridiculous, 
    agincourt.  sit  see, 
 minding true     mockeries be.
