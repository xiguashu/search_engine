    |      ii. troy. a room  priam's palace. 
 enter priam, hector, troilus, paris,  helenus  priam     hours, lives, speeches spent, 
     nestor   greeks: 
 'deliver helen,   damage else-- 
  honour, loss  time, travail, expense, 
 wounds, friends,    dear   consumed 
  hot digestion   cormorant war-- 
   struck off.' hector,    to't? 
 hector     lesser fears  greeks   
    toucheth  particular, 
 yet, dread priam, 
    lady   softer bowels, 
  spongy  suck   sense  fear, 
  ready  cry  '   follows?' 
  hector is:  wound  peace  surety, 
 surety secure;  modest doubt  call'd 
  beacon   wise,  tent  searches 
   bottom   worst.  helen go: 
    sword  drawn   question, 
  tithe soul, 'mongst  thousand dismes, 
 hath   dear  helen;  mean,  ours: 
    lost   tenths  ours, 
  guard a     worth  us, 
    name,     ten, 
  merit's   reason  denies 
  yielding   up? 
 troilus  fie, fie,  brother! 
 weigh   worth  honour  a king 
  great   dread father  a scale 
  common ounces?    counters sum 
   proportion   infinite? 
  buckle  a waist  fathomless 
  spans  inches  diminutive 
  fears  reasons? fie,  godly shame! 
 helenus   marvel,   bite  sharp  reasons, 
    empty  them.    father 
 bear  great sway   affairs  reasons, 
   speech hath   tells  so? 
 troilus     dreams  slumbers, brother priest; 
  fur  gloves  reason.   
  reasons: 
    enemy intends  harm; 
   a sword employ'd  perilous, 
  reason flies  object   harm: 
  marvels then,  helenus beholds 
 a grecian   sword,    set 
   wings  reason   heels 
  fly  chidden mercury  jove, 
   a star disorb'd? nay,   talk  reason, 
  shut  gates  sleep: manhood  honour 
   hare-hearts,    fat 
  thoughts 
   cramm'd reason: reason  respect 
  livers pale  lustihood deject. 
 hector  brother,    worth   doth cost 
  holding. 
 troilus    aught,   'tis valued? 
 hector    dwells    will; 
  holds  estimate  dignity 
    'tis precious   
    prizer: 'tis mad idolatry 
    service greater   god 
    dotes   attributive 
   infectiously  affects, 
   image   affected merit. 
 troilus    to-day a wife,   election 
  led    conduct   will; 
   enkindled   eyes  ears, 
  traded pilots 'twixt  dangerous shores 
    judgment:    avoid, 
    distaste   elected, 
  wife  chose?     evasion 
  blench     stand firm  honour: 
  turn    silks   merchant, 
    soil'd them,   remainder viands 
    throw  unrespective sieve, 
     full.   thought meet 
 paris    vengeance   greeks: 
  breath  full consent bellied  sails; 
  seas  winds,  wranglers,  a truce 
    service:  touch'd  ports desired, 
     aunt   greeks held captive, 
  brought a grecian queen,  youth  freshness 
 wrinkles apollo's,   stale  morning. 
    her?  grecians   aunt: 
   worth keeping? why,   a pearl, 
  price hath launch'd  a thousand ships, 
  turn'd crown'd kings  merchants. 
   avouch 'twas wisdom paris went-- 
    needs,    cried 'go, go,'-- 
   confess  brought home noble prize-- 
    needs,    clapp'd  hands 
  cried 'inestimable!'--why    
  issue   proper wisdoms rate, 
   a deed  fortune  did, 
 beggar  estimation   prized 
 richer  sea  land? o, theft  base, 
    stol'n    fear  keep! 
 but, thieves, unworthy  a   stol'n, 
    country    disgrace, 
  fear  warrant   native place! 
 cassandra  [within]  cry, trojans, cry! 
 priam   noise?  shriek  this? 
 troilus  'tis  mad sister,     voice. 
 cassandra  [within]  cry, trojans! 
 hector    cassandra. 

 enter cassandra, raving  cassandra  cry, trojans, cry! lend  ten thousand eyes, 
    fill   prophetic tears. 
 hector  peace, sister, peace! 
 cassandra  virgins  boys, mid-age  wrinkled eld, 
 soft infancy,   canst  cry, 
 add   clamours!   pay betimes 
 a moiety   mass  moan  come. 
 cry, trojans, cry! practise  eyes  tears! 
 troy   be,  goodly ilion stand; 
  firebrand brother, paris, burns  all. 
 cry, trojans, cry! a helen  a woe: 
 cry, cry! troy burns,    helen go. 

 exit  hector  now, youthful troilus,    high strains 
  divination   sister work 
  touches  remorse?    blood 
  madly hot   discourse  reason, 
  fear  bad success  a bad cause, 
  qualify  same? 
 troilus  why, brother hector, 
      justness    
      event doth form it, 
   deject  courage   minds, 
  cassandra's mad:  brain-sick raptures 
  distaste  goodness  a quarrel 
  hath   honours  engaged 
    gracious.   private part, 
     touch'd   priam's sons: 
  jove forbid       
     offend  weakest spleen 
  fight   maintain! 
 paris     world convince  levity 
    undertakings   counsels: 
   attest  gods,  full consent 
 gave wings   propension  cut  
  fears attending   dire a project. 
  what, alas,    single arms? 
  propugnation    man's valour, 
  stand  push  enmity   
  quarrel  excite? yet,  protest, 
     pass  difficulties 
    ample power    will, 
 paris  ne'er retract   hath done, 
  faint   pursuit. 
 priam  paris,  speak 
   besotted   sweet delights: 
    honey still,    gall; 
    valiant   praise  all. 
 paris  sir,  propose     
  pleasures  a beauty brings  it; 
      soil   fair rape 
 wiped off,  honourable keeping her. 
  treason     ransack'd queen, 
 disgrace   great worths  shame  me, 
   deliver  possession  
  terms  base compulsion!    
   degenerate a strain   
   set footing   generous bosoms? 
    meanest spirit   party 
  a heart    sword  draw 
  helen  defended,    noble 
  life  ill bestow'd  death unfamed 
  helen   subject; then,  say, 
    fight   whom,   well, 
  world's large spaces  parallel. 
 hector  paris  troilus,     well, 
      question   hand 
  glozed,  superficially:   
  young men,  aristotle thought 
 unfit  hear moral philosophy: 
  reasons  allege   conduce 
   hot passion  distemper'd blood 
     a free determination 
 'twixt   wrong,  pleasure  revenge 
  ears  deaf  adders   voice 
   true decision. nature craves 
  dues  render'd   owners: now, 
  nearer debt   humanity 
  wife    husband?   law 
  nature  corrupted  affection, 
   great minds,  partial indulgence 
   benumbed wills, resist  same, 
   a law   well-order'd nation 
  curb  raging appetites   
  disobedient  refractory. 
  helen   wife  sparta's king, 
      is,  moral laws 
  nature   nations speak aloud 
     return'd:   persist 
   wrong extenuates  wrong, 
      heavy. hector's opinion 
      truth;  ne'ertheless, 
  spritely brethren,  propend   
  resolution   helen still, 
  'tis a   hath   dependance 
   joint   dignities. 
 troilus  why,   touch'd  life   design: 
    glory    affected 
   performance   heaving spleens, 
     a drop  trojan blood 
 spent    defence. but, worthy hector, 
   a theme  honour  renown, 
 a spur  valiant  magnanimous deeds, 
  present courage  beat   foes, 
  fame  time   canonize us; 
 for,  presume, brave hector   lose 
  rich advantage  a promised glory 
  smiles   forehead   action 
   wide world's revenue. 
 hector    yours, 
  valiant offspring  great priamus. 
   a roisting challenge   
  dun  factious nobles   greeks 
  strike amazement   drowsy spirits: 
   advertised  great general slept, 
  emulation   army crept: 
 this,  presume,  wake him.
