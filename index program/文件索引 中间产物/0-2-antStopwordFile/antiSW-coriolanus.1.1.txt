 marcius     give good words  thee  flatter 
 beneath abhorring.    have,  curs, 
    peace  war?   affrights you, 
     proud.   trusts  you, 
    find  lions, finds  hares; 
  foxes, geese:    surer, no, 
    coal  fire   ice, 
  hailstone   sun.  virtue  
    worthy  offence subdues  
  curse  justice  it. 
  deserves greatness 
 deserves  hate;   affections  
 a sick man's appetite,  desires   
   increase  evil.   depends 
   favours swims  fins  lead 
  hews  oaks  rushes. hang ye! trust ye? 
   minute   change a mind,

  city   stored. 
 marcius  hang 'em!  say! 
  sit   fire,  presume   
   i'  capitol;    rise, 
  thrives   declines; side factions 
  give  
 conjectural marriages; making parties strong 
  feebling   stand    liking 
   cobbled shoes.    
 grain enough! 
   nobility lay   ruth, 
      sword,   a quarry 
  thousands   quarter'd slaves,  high 
    pick  lance. 
 menenius  nay,     persuaded; 
   abundantly  lack discretion, 
    passing cowardly. but,  beseech you, 
     troop? 
 marcius    dissolved: hang 'em! 
     an-hungry; sigh'd  proverbs, 
  hunger broke stone walls,  dogs  eat, 
  meat    mouths,   gods   
 corn   rich men only:   shreds 
  vented  complainings;   answer'd, 
  a petition granted them, a strange one-- 
  break  heart  generosity, 
   bold power  pale--they threw  caps 
    hang    horns o'  moon, 
 shouting  emulation. 
 menenius    granted them? 
 marcius   tribunes  defend  vulgar wisdoms, 
    choice:  junius brutus, 
 sicinius velutus,    not--'sdeath! 
  rabble    unroof'd  city, 
 ere  prevail'd  me:    time 
 win  power  throw  greater themes

  musty superfluity. see,   elders. 

 enter cominius, titus lartius,   senators; junius brutus  sicinius velutus   senator  marcius, 'tis true     told us; 
  volsces   arms. 
 marcius    a leader, 
 tullus aufidius,   put   't. 
  sin  envying  nobility, 
         am, 
      he. 
 cominius    fought together.

    proud  hunt. 
  senator  then, worthy marcius, 
 attend  cominius   wars. 
 cominius      promise. 
 marcius  sir,  is; 
    constant. titus lartius, thou 
 shalt     strike  tullus' face. 
 what, art thou stiff? stand'st out? 
 titus  no, caius marcius;

 ere stay   business. 
 menenius  o, true-bred!

  greatest friends attend us.

  marcius   worthy  priority. 
 cominius  noble marcius! 
  senator  [  citizens]     homes;  gone! 
 marcius  nay,   follow: 
  volsces   corn;   rats thither 
  gnaw  garners. worshipful mutiners, 
  valour puts  forth: pray, follow. 

 citizens steal away. exeunt   sicinius  brutus  sicinius      proud    marcius? 
 brutus     equal. 
 sicinius     chosen tribunes   people,-- 
 brutus  mark'd   lip  eyes? 
 sicinius  nay.   taunts. 
 brutus   moved,    spare  gird  gods. 
 sicinius  be-mock  modest moon. 
 brutus   present wars devour him:   grown 
  proud    valiant. 
 sicinius   a nature, 
 tickled  good success, disdains  shadow 
   treads   noon:     
  insolence  brook   commanded 
  cominius. 
 brutus  fame,     aims, 
      graced,   
   held   attain'd   
 a place   first:   miscarries 
    general's fault,   perform 
   utmost  a man,  giddy censure 
   cry   marcius 'o   
  borne  business!' 
 sicinius  besides,    well, 
 opinion   sticks  marcius  
   demerits rob cominius. 
 brutus  come: 
   cominius' honours   marcius. 
  marcius earned  not,    faults 
  marcius   honours,   
  aught  merit not. 
 sicinius   hence,  hear 
   dispatch  made,    fashion,

   present action. 
 brutus  lets along.
