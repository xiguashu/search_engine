sonnet viiisonnet viiimusic  hear,  hear'st thou music sadly?
sweets  sweets war not, joy delights  joy.
 lovest thou   thou receivest  gladly,
  receivest  pleasure thine annoy?
  true concord  well-tuned sounds,
 unions married,  offend thine ear,
   sweetly chide thee,  confounds
 singleness  parts  thou shouldst bear.
mark   string, sweet husband  another,
strikes     mutual ordering,
resembling sire  child  happy mother
   one,  pleasing note  sing:
 speechless song,  many,  one,
sings   thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'
