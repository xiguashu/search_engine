 enter coriolanus, aufidius,    coriolanus      walls  rome tomorrow 
 set   host.  partner   action, 
   report   volscian lords,  plainly 
   borne  business. 
 aufidius    ends 
   respected; stopp'd  ears  
  general suit  rome;  admitted 
 a private whisper, no,    friends 
  thought    you. 
 coriolanus     man, 
   a crack'd heart     rome, 
 loved    measure  a father; 
 nay, godded me, indeed.  latest refuge 
   send him;    love  have, 
   show'd sourly  him,   offer'd 
   conditions,    refuse 
    accept;  grace   
  thought    more, a   
   yielded to: fresh embassies  suits, 
    state  private friends,  
   lend ear to. ha!  shout  this? 

 shout      tempted  infringe  vow 
    time 'tis made?   not. 

 enter  mourning habits, virgilia, volumnia, leading young marcius, valeria,  attendants   wife  foremost;   honour'd mould 
   trunk  framed,    hand 
  grandchild   blood. but, out, affection! 
  bond  privilege  nature, break! 
    virtuous   obstinate. 
    curt'sy worth?   doves' eyes, 
    gods forsworn?  melt,    
  stronger earth  others.  mother bows; 
   olympus  a molehill  
  supplication nod:   young boy 
 hath  aspect  intercession,  
 great nature cries 'deny not.'   volsces 
 plough rome  harrow italy:   
   a gosling  obey instinct,  stand, 
   a   author   
  knew   kin. 
 virgilia   lord  husband! 
 coriolanus   eyes      wore  rome. 
 virgilia   sorrow  delivers   changed 
    so. 
 coriolanus   a dull actor now, 
   forgot  part,    out, 
   a full disgrace.    flesh, 
 forgive  tyranny;     
   'forgive  romans.' o, a kiss 
 long   exile, sweet   revenge! 
 now,   jealous queen  heaven,  kiss 
  carried  thee, dear;   true lip 
 hath virgin'd  e'er since.  gods!  prate, 
    noble mother   world 
 leave unsaluted: sink,  knee, i'  earth; 

 kneels   thy deep duty  impression show 
    common sons. 
 volumnia  o, stand  blest! 
 whilst,   softer cushion   flint, 
  kneel  thee;  unproperly 
 show duty,  mistaken    
   child  parent. 

 kneels  coriolanus    this? 
  knees  me?   corrected son? 
    pebbles   hungry beach 
 fillip  stars;    mutinous winds 
 strike  proud cedars 'gainst  fiery sun; 
 murdering impossibility,   
   be, slight work. 
 volumnia  thou art  warrior; 
  holp  frame thee.     lady? 
 coriolanus   noble sister  publicola, 
  moon  rome, chaste   icicle 
  curdied   frost  purest snow 
  hangs  dian's temple: dear valeria!

    interpretation  full time 
  show   yourself. 
 coriolanus   god  soldiers, 
   consent  supreme jove, inform 
 thy thoughts  nobleness;  thou mayst prove 
  shame unvulnerable,  stick i'  wars 
  a great sea-mark, standing  flaw, 
  saving   eye thee! 
 volumnia   knee, sirrah. 
 coriolanus    brave boy! 
 volumnia   he,  wife,  lady,  myself, 
  suitors  you. 
 coriolanus   beseech you, peace: 
 or,  you'ld ask, remember  before: 
     forsworn  grant   
  held   denials.   bid  
 dismiss  soldiers,  capitulate 
   rome's mechanics:    
    unnatural: desire  
  ally  rages  revenges  
  colder reasons. 
 volumnia  o,  more,  more! 
       grant   thing; 
       ask,   
   deny already:    ask; 
 that,   fail   request,  blame 
  hang   hardness:  hear us. 
 coriolanus  aufidius,   volsces, mark;   
 hear nought  rome  private.  request? 
 volumnia     silent   speak,  raiment 
  state  bodies  bewray  life

   eyes flow  joy, hearts dance 
  comforts, 
 constrains  weep  shake  fear  sorrow; 
 making  mother, wife  child   
  son,  husband   father tearing 
  country's bowels out.   poor  
 thine enmity's  capital: thou barr'st  
  prayers   gods,   a comfort 
     enjoy;    we, 
 alas,      country pray. 
 whereto   bound,   thy victory, 
 whereto   bound? alack,    lose 
  country,  dear nurse,   thy person, 
  comfort   country.   find 
  evident calamity,

 must,  a foreign recreant,  led 
  manacles   streets,   
 triumphantly tread  thy country's ruin, 
  bear  palm   bravely shed 
 thy wife  children's blood.  myself, son, 
  purpose   wait  fortune  
  wars determine:    persuade thee 
   show a noble grace   parts 
  seek    one, thou shalt  sooner 
 march  assault thy country   tread-- 
 trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,

 virgilia  ay,  mine,

 rising  volumnia  nay,     thus. 
       request  tend 
  save  romans,   destroy 
  volsces   serve,   condemn us, 
  poisonous   honour: no;  suit

 '  received;'     side 
 give  all-hail  thee  cry ' blest 
  making   peace!' thou know'st, great son,

   ensuing age abhorr'd.' speak  me, son: 
 thou hast affected  fine strains  honour, 
  imitate  graces   gods;

 show'd thy dear mother  courtesy, 
  she, poor hen, fond    brood, 
  cluck'd thee   wars  safely home, 
 loaden  honour.   request's unjust, 
  spurn  back:      so, 
 thou art  honest;   gods  plague thee, 
  thou restrain'st    duty  
  a mother's part belongs.  turns away:
