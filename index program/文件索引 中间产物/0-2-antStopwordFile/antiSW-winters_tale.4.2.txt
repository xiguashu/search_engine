 enter polixenes  camillo  polixenes   pray thee, good camillo,    importunate: 
 'tis a sickness denying thee  thing; a death

 camillo    fifteen years     country:  
      part  aired abroad,  
 desire  lay  bones there. besides,  penitent 
 king,  master, hath   me;   feeling 
 sorrows     allay,   o'erween  
  so,    spur   departure. 
 polixenes   thou lovest me, camillo, wipe    rest  
 thy services  leaving  now:      
 thee thine  goodness hath made;    
   thee     thee: thou,  
   businesses    thee  
 sufficiently manage,   stay  execute 
  thyself     thee   
 services thou hast done;       
 considered,     cannot,    
 thankful  thee    study,   profit 
   heaping friendships.   fatal 
 country, sicilia, prithee speak  more;   
 naming punishes    remembrance   
 penitent,  thou callest him,  reconciled king, 
  brother;  loss    precious queen 
  children      afresh lamented. 
   me,  sawest thou  prince florizel,  
 son? kings    unhappy,  issue

 intelligence,    seldom   house  a 
  homely shepherd; a man,  say,   
  nothing,    imagination   
 neighbours,  grown   unspeakable estate. 
 camillo    heard, sir,   a man,  hath a 
 daughter   rare note:  report

 lay   thoughts  sicilia. 
 camillo   willingly obey  command. 
 polixenes    camillo!   disguise ourselves.
