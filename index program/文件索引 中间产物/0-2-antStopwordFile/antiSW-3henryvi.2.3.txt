 alarum. excursions. enter warwick  warwick  forspent  toil,  runners  a race, 
  lay   a    breathe; 
  strokes received,   blows repaid, 
  robb'd  strong-knit sinews   strength, 
  spite  spite    rest awhile. 

 enter edward, running  edward  smile, gentle heaven!  strike, ungentle death!

 enter richard  richard  ah, warwick,  hast thou withdrawn thyself? 
 thy brother's blood  thirsty earth hath drunk, 
 broach'd   steely point  clifford's lance; 
     pangs  death  cried, 
   a dismal clangour heard  far, 
 'warwick, revenge! brother, revenge  death!'

 where'er  be,  heaven   earth. 
 richard  brother, give  thy hand; and, gentle warwick, 
   embrace thee   weary arms: 
 i,    weep,  melt  woe 
  winter  cut   spring-time so. 
 warwick  away, away!  more, sweet lords farewell. 
 george         troops, 
  give  leave  fly    stay; 
  call  pillars   stand  us; 
 and,   thrive, promise   rewards 
  victors wear   olympian games: 
   plant courage   quailing breasts; 
    hope  life  victory. 
 forslow  longer,    amain.
