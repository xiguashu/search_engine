sonnet cxxisonnet cxxi'tis    vile  vile esteem'd,
    receives reproach  being,
   pleasure lost    deem'd
   feeling   others' seeing:
    false adulterate eyes
give salutation   sportive blood?
   frailties   frailer spies,
   wills count bad    good?
no,     am,    level
  abuses reckon   own:
   straight,     bevel;
  rank thoughts  deeds    shown;
  general evil  maintain,
 men  bad,    badness reign.
