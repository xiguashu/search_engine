    |      iii. a wood. 
 enter edgar  edgar   heard  proclaim'd; 
    happy hollow  a tree 
 escaped  hunt.  port  free;  place, 
  guard,   unusual vigilance, 
   attend  taking. whiles   'scape, 
   preserve myself:   bethought 
    basest   poorest shape 
   penury,  contempt  man, 
 brought   beast:  face  grime  filth; 
 blanket  loins: elf   hair  knots; 
   presented nakedness out-face 
  winds  persecutions   sky. 
  country   proof  precedent 
  bedlam beggars, who,  roaring voices, 
 strike   numb'd  mortified bare arms 
 pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs  rosemary; 
    horrible object,   farms, 
 poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes,  mills, 
   lunatic bans,   prayers, 
 enforce  charity. poor turlygod! poor tom! 
   yet: edgar   am.
