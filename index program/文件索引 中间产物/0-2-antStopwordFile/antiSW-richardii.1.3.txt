   unstringed viol  a harp, 
   a cunning instrument cased up, 
 or,  open, put   hands 
    touch  tune  harmony:

 shorten  days thou canst  sullen sorrow, 
  pluck nights  me,   lend a morrow; 
 thou canst  time  furrow   age, 
  stop  wrinkle   pilgrimage; 
 thy word  current     death, 
  dead, thy kingdom  buy  breath. 
 king richard   thy son  banish'd  good advice, 
 whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave: 
    justice seem'st thou   lour?

  urged   a judge;     
    bid  argue  a father.
