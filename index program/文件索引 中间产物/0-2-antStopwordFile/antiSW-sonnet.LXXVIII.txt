sonnet lxxviiisonnet lxxviiiso oft   invoked thee   muse
   fair assistance   verse
  alien pen hath   
  thee  poesy disperse.
thine eyes  taught  dumb  high  sing
 heavy ignorance aloft  fly
 added feathers   learned's wing
  grace a double majesty.
   proud     compile,
 influence  thine  born  thee:
 others' works thou dost  mend  style,
 arts  thy sweet graces graced be;
 thou art   art  dost advance
 high  learning  rude ignorance.
