sonnet cxlivsonnet cxlivtwo loves    comfort  despair,
   spirits  suggest  still:
  angel  a   fair,
 worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.
 win    hell,  female evil
tempteth   angel   side,
  corrupt  saint   a devil,
wooing  purity   foul pride.
    angel  turn'd fiend
suspect  may,    tell;
    me,    friend,
 guess  angel  another's hell:
    ne'er know,  live  doubt,
  bad angel fire  good  out.
