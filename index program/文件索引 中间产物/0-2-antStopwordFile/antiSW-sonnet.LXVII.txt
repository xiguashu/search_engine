sonnet lxviisonnet lxviiah! wherefore  infection   live,
   presence grace impiety,
 sin   advantage  achieve
 lace    society?
  false painting imitate  cheek
 steal dead    living hue?
  poor beauty indirectly seek
roses  shadow,   rose  true?
   live,  nature bankrupt is,
beggar'd  blood  blush  lively veins?
  hath  exchequer   his,
and, proud  many, lives   gains.
o,   stores,  show  wealth  
 days long since,     bad.
