 mowbray      occasion   arms; 
  gladly    satisfied 
    means   advance  
    forehead bold  big  
   power  puissance   king. 
 hastings   present musters grow   file 
    twenty thousand men  choice; 
   supplies live largely   hope 
  great northumberland,  bosom burns 
   incensed fire  injuries. 
 lord bardolph   question then, lord hastings, standeth thus; 
   present   twenty thousand 
  hold  head  northumberland? 
 hastings   him,  may. 
 lord bardolph  yea, marry,   point: 
       thought  feeble, 
  judgment is,    step   
     assistance   hand; 
   a theme  bloody-faced   
 conjecture, expectation,  surmise 
  aids incertain    admitted. 
 archbishop  york  'tis  true, lord bardolph;   
   young hotspur's case  shrewsbury. 
 lord bardolph   was,  lord;  lined   hope, 
 eating  air  promise  supply, 
 flattering   project  a power 
  smaller   smallest   thoughts: 
  so,  great imagination 
 proper  madmen, led  powers  death 
  winking leap'd  destruction. 
 hastings  but,   leave,     hurt 
  lay  likelihoods  forms  hope. 
 lord bardolph  yes,   present quality  war, 
   instant action: a   foot 
 lives   hope    early spring 
    appearing buds;   prove fruit, 
 hope     warrant  despair 
  frosts  bite them.     build, 
   survey  plot,  draw  model; 
      figure   house, 
    rate  cost   erection; 
    find outweighs ability,

 hastings  grant   hopes,    fair birth, 
   still-born,     possess'd 
  utmost   expectation, 
     a body strong enough, 
    are,  equal   king. 
 lord bardolph  what,   king    twenty thousand? 
 hastings     more; nay,   much, lord bardolph. 
   divisions,   times  brawl, 
    heads:  power   french, 
    glendower; perforce a  
    us:    unfirm king 
   divided;   coffers sound 
  hollow poverty  emptiness. 
 archbishop  york     draw   strengths  
      full puissance, 
    dreaded. 
 hastings      so, 
  leaves   unarm'd,  french  welsh 
 baying    heels:  fear that.

  publish  occasion   arms. 
  commonwealth  sick    choice; 
  over-greedy love hath surfeited: 
  habitation giddy  unsure 
 hath   buildeth   vulgar heart. 
 o thou fond many,   loud applause 
 didst thou beat heaven  blessing bolingbroke, 
     thou wouldst   be! 
    trimm'd  thine  desires, 
 thou, beastly feeder, art  full  him, 
  thou provokest thyself  cast  up. 
 so, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge 
 thy glutton bosom   royal richard; 
   thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up, 
  howl'st  find it.  trust   
  times? 
  that,  richard lived,    die, 
    enamour'd   grave: 
 thou,  threw'st dust   goodly head 
   proud london   sighing  
   admired heels  bolingbroke, 
 criest  'o earth, yield   king again, 
   thou this!' o thoughts  men accursed! 
      best;  present worst. 
 mowbray     draw  numbers  set on? 
 hastings    time's subjects,  time bids  gone.
