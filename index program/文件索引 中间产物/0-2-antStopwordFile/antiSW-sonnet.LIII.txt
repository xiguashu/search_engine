sonnet liiisonnet liiiwhat   substance, whereof   made,
 millions  strange shadows   tend?
   hath,  one,  shade,
 you,  one,   shadow lend.
describe adonis,   counterfeit
 poorly imitated  you;
 helen's cheek  art  beauty set,
   grecian tires  painted new:
speak   spring  foison   year;
  doth shadow   beauty show,
    bounty doth appear;
    blessed shape  know.
  external grace    part,
   none,  you,  constant heart.
