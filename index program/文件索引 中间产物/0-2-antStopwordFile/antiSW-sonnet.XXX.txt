sonnet xxxsonnet xxxwhen   sessions  sweet silent thought
 summon  remembrance   past,
 sigh  lack   a   sought,
   woes  wail  dear time's waste:
   drown  eye, unused  flow,
 precious friends hid  death's dateless night,
 weep afresh love's long  cancell'd woe,
 moan  expense   a vanish'd sight:
   grieve  grievances foregone,
 heavily  woe  woe  o'er
 sad account  fore-bemoaned moan,
   pay    paid before.
       thee, dear friend,
 losses  restored  sorrows end.
