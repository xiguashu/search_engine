 enter john  gaunt sick,   duke  york, & c  john  gaunt    king come,    breathe   
  wholesome counsel   unstaid youth? 
 duke  york  vex  yourself,  strive    breath; 
    vain  counsel   ear. 
 john  gaunt  o,     tongues  dying men 
 enforce attention  deep harmony: 
  words  scarce,   seldom spent  vain, 
   breathe truth  breathe  words  pain. 
        listen'd  
    youth  ease  taught  glose; 
   men's ends mark'd   lives before: 
  setting sun,  music   close, 
    taste  sweets,  sweetest last, 
 writ  remembrance    long past: 
  richard  life's counsel   hear, 
  death's sad tale   undeaf  ear. 
 duke  york  no;   stopp'd   flattering sounds, 
  praises,   taste  wise  fond, 
 lascivious metres,   venom sound 
  open ear  youth doth  listen; 
 report  fashions  proud italy, 
  manners   tardy apish nation 
 limps   base imitation. 
  doth  world thrust  a vanity-- 
    new,   respect  vile-- 
    quickly buzzed   ears? 
    late  counsel   heard, 
   doth mutiny  wit's regard. 
 direct       choose: 
 'tis breath thou lack'st,   breath wilt thou lose. 
 john  gaunt  methinks   a prophet  inspired 
   expiring  foretell  him: 
  rash fierce blaze  riot  last, 
  violent fires  burn  themselves; 
 small showers  long,  sudden storms  short; 
  tires betimes  spurs  fast betimes; 
  eager feeding food doth choke  feeder: 
 light vanity, insatiate cormorant, 
 consuming means,  preys  itself.

   world's ransom, blessed mary's son, 
  land   dear souls,  dear dear land, 
 dear   reputation   world, 
   leased out,  die pronouncing it, 
   a tenement  pelting farm: 
 england, bound    triumphant sea 
  rocky shore beats   envious siege 
  watery neptune,   bound   shame, 
  inky blots  rotten parchment bonds: 
  england,   wont  conquer others, 
 hath  a shameful conquest  itself. 
 ah,   scandal vanish   life,

 gaunt     grave, gaunt  a grave, 
  hollow womb inherits nought  bones.

     shake   slavish yoke, 
 imp   drooping country's broken wing, 
 redeem  broking pawn  blemish'd crown, 
 wipe   dust  hides  sceptre's gilt 
   high majesty   itself, 
     post  ravenspurgh; 
    faint,  fearing   so, 
 stay   secret,    go.
