sonnet cxxxsonnet cxxxmy mistress' eyes     sun;
coral    red   lips' red;
 snow  white,    breasts  dun;
 hairs  wires, black wires grow   head.
   roses damask'd, red  white,
   roses     cheeks;
   perfumes    delight
   breath    mistress reeks.
 love  hear  speak,    
 music hath a   pleasing sound;
 grant    a goddess go;
 mistress,   walks, treads   ground:
 yet,  heaven,    love  rare
   belied  false compare.
