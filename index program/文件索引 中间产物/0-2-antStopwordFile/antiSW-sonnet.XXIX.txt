sonnet xxixsonnet xxixwhen,  disgrace  fortune  men's eyes,
   beweep  outcast state
 trouble deaf heaven   bootless cries
     curse  fate,
wishing      rich  hope,
featured  him,    friends possess'd,
desiring  man's art   man's scope,
    enjoy contented least;
   thoughts   despising,
haply    thee,    state,
   lark  break  day arising
 sullen earth, sings hymns  heaven's gate;
 thy sweet love remember'd  wealth brings
   scorn  change  state  kings.
