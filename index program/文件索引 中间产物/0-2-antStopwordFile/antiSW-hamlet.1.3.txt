 enter laertes  ophelia  laertes   necessaries  embark'd: farewell: 
 and, sister,   winds give benefit 
  convoy  assistant,   sleep, 
    hear  you. 
 ophelia    doubt that? 
 laertes   hamlet   trifling   favour, 
 hold  a fashion  a toy  blood, 
 a violet   youth  primy nature, 
 forward,  permanent, sweet,  lasting, 
  perfume  suppliance  a minute;  more. 
 ophelia     so? 
 laertes     more; 
  nature, crescent,   grow  
  thews  bulk, but,   temple waxes, 
   service   mind  soul 
 grows wide withal.   loves  now, 
    soil  cautel doth besmirch 
  virtue   will:    fear, 
  greatness weigh'd,      own; 
     subject   birth: 
   not,  unvalued persons do, 
 carve  himself;    choice depends 
  safety  health    state; 
     choice  circumscribed 
   voice  yielding   body 
 whereof    head.      loves you, 
  fits  wisdom      
        place 
  give   deed;     
   main voice  denmark  withal. 
  weigh  loss  honour  sustain, 
    credent ear  list  songs, 
  lose  heart,   chaste treasure open 
   unmaster'd importunity. 
 fear it, ophelia, fear it,  dear sister, 
      rear   affection, 
    shot  danger  desire. 
  chariest maid  prodigal enough, 
   unmask  beauty   moon: 
 virtue  'scapes  calumnious strokes: 
  canker galls  infants   spring, 
  oft   buttons  disclosed, 
    morn  liquid dew  youth 
 contagious blastments   imminent. 
  wary then;  safety lies  fear: 
 youth   rebels,    near. 
 ophelia     effect   good lesson keep, 
  watchman   heart. but, good  brother, 
  not,   ungracious pastors do, 
 show   steep  thorny   heaven; 
 whiles,  a puff'd  reckless libertine, 
   primrose path  dalliance treads, 
  recks    rede. 
 laertes  o, fear  not. 
  stay  long:    father comes. 

 enter polonius  a double blessing  a double grace, 
 occasion smiles  a  leave. 
 lord polonius   here, laertes! aboard, aboard,  shame! 
  wind sits   shoulder   sail, 
    stay'd for. there;  blessing  thee! 
    precepts  thy memory 
  thou character. give thy thoughts  tongue, 
   unproportioned thought  act. 
  thou familiar,    means vulgar. 
  friends thou hast,   adoption tried, 
 grapple   thy soul  hoops  steel; 
    dull thy palm  entertainment 
   new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. beware 
  entrance  a quarrel,   in, 
 bear't   opposed  beware  thee. 
 give   thy ear,   thy voice; 
   man's censure,  reserve thy judgment. 
 costly thy habit  thy purse  buy, 
   express'd  fancy; rich,  gaudy; 
   apparel oft proclaims  man, 
    france    rank  station 
   a  select  generous chief  that. 
  a borrower  a lender be; 
  loan oft loses    friend, 
  borrowing dulls  edge  husbandry. 
   all:  thine ownself  true, 
    follow,   night  day, 
 thou canst    false   man. 
 farewell:  blessing season   thee! 
 laertes   humbly     leave,  lord. 
 lord polonius   time invites you; go;  servants tend. 
 laertes  farewell, ophelia;  remember  
      you. 
 ophelia  'tis   memory lock'd, 
       key  it. 
 laertes  farewell. 

 exit  lord polonius   is't, ophelia,  hath   you? 
 ophelia    you,  touching  lord hamlet. 
 lord polonius  marry,  bethought: 
 'tis told me,  hath  oft  late 
  private time  you;    
    audience   free  bounteous: 
    so,   'tis put  me, 
      caution,    you, 
    understand    
   behoves  daughter   honour. 
    you? give    truth. 
 ophelia   hath,  lord,  late   tenders 
   affection  me. 
 lord polonius  affection! pooh!  speak  a green girl, 
 unsifted   perilous circumstance. 
     tenders,   call them? 
 ophelia     know,  lord,    think. 
 lord polonius  marry,  teach you:   a baby; 
    ta'en  tenders  true pay, 
    sterling. tender   dearly; 
 or--not  crack  wind   poor phrase, 
 running  thus--you'll tender  a fool. 
 ophelia   lord,  hath importuned   love 
  honourable fashion. 
 lord polonius  ay, fashion   call it;  to,  to. 
 ophelia   hath  countenance   speech,  lord, 
     holy vows  heaven. 
 lord polonius  ay, springes  catch woodcocks.   know, 
   blood burns,  prodigal  soul 
 lends  tongue vows:  blazes, daughter, 
 giving  light  heat, extinct  both, 
    promise,    a-making, 
      fire.   time 
   scanter   maiden presence; 
 set  entreatments  a higher rate 
  a command  parley.  lord hamlet, 
     him,    young 
   a larger tether   walk 
     you:  few, ophelia, 
     vows;    brokers, 
    dye   investments show, 
  mere implorators  unholy suits, 
 breathing  sanctified  pious bawds, 
    beguile.    all: 
   not,  plain terms,   time forth, 
    slander  moment leisure, 
   give words  talk   lord hamlet. 
  to't,  charge you:   ways. 
 ophelia    obey,  lord.
