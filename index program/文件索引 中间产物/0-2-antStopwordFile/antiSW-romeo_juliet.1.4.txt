    |      iv. a street. 
 enter romeo, mercutio, benvolio,     maskers, torch-bearers,    romeo  what,   speech  spoke   excuse? 
      a apology? 
 benvolio   date     prolixity: 
    cupid hoodwink'd  a scarf, 
 bearing a tartar's painted bow  lath, 
 scaring  ladies  a crow-keeper; 
   without-book prologue, faintly spoke 
   prompter,   entrance: 
    measure     will; 
  measure  a measure,   gone. 
 romeo  give  a torch:      ambling; 
   heavy,   bear  light. 
 mercutio  nay, gentle romeo,     dance. 
 romeo   i,  me:   dancing shoes 
  nimble soles:   a soul  lead 
  stakes    ground   move. 
 mercutio    a lover; borrow cupid's wings, 
  soar    a common bound. 
 romeo     sore enpierced   shaft 
  soar   light feathers,   bound, 
   bound a pitch  dull woe: 
  love's heavy burden   sink. 
 mercutio  and,  sink  it,   burden love; 
  great oppression  a tender thing. 
 romeo   love a tender thing?    rough, 
  rude,  boisterous,   pricks  thorn. 
 mercutio   love  rough  you,  rough  love; 
 prick love  pricking,   beat love down. 
 give  a case  put  visage in: 
 a visor  a visor!  care  
  curious eye doth quote deformities? 
    beetle brows  blush  me. 
 benvolio  come, knock  enter;   sooner in, 
    betake    legs. 
 romeo  a torch  me:  wantons light  heart 
 tickle  senseless rushes   heels, 
    proverb'd  a grandsire phrase; 
   a candle-holder,   on. 
  game  ne'er  fair,    done. 
 mercutio  tut, dun's  mouse,  constable's  word: 
  thou art dun,  draw thee   mire 
   sir-reverence love,  thou stick'st 
    ears. come,  burn daylight, ho! 
 romeo  nay,   so. 
 mercutio   mean, sir,  delay 
  waste  lights  vain,  lamps  day. 
   good meaning,   judgment sits 
  times   ere     wits. 
 romeo          mask; 
  'tis  wit  go. 
 mercutio  why,   ask? 
 romeo   dream'd a dream to-night. 
 mercutio     i. 
 romeo  well,   yours? 
 mercutio   dreamers  lie. 
 romeo   bed asleep,    dream  true. 
 mercutio  o, then,   queen mab hath   you. 
    fairies' midwife,    
  shape  bigger   agate-stone 
   fore-finger   alderman, 
 drawn  a team   atomies 
 athwart men's noses   lie asleep; 
  wagon-spokes   long spiders' legs, 
  cover   wings  grasshoppers, 
  traces   smallest spider's web, 
  collars   moonshine's watery beams, 
  whip  cricket's bone,  lash  film, 
  wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, 
   big  a   worm 
 prick'd   lazy finger  a maid; 
  chariot   empty hazel-nut 
    joiner squirrel   grub, 
 time  o' mind  fairies' coachmakers. 
    state  gallops night  night 
  lovers' brains,    dream  love; 
 o'er courtiers' knees,  dream  court'sies straight, 
 o'er lawyers' fingers,  straight dream  fees, 
 o'er ladies ' lips,  straight  kisses dream, 
  oft  angry mab  blisters plagues, 
   breaths  sweetmeats tainted are: 
   gallops o'er a courtier's nose, 
   dreams   smelling  a suit; 
      a tithe-pig's tail 
 tickling a parson's nose  a' lies asleep, 
  dreams,    benefice: 
   driveth o'er a soldier's neck, 
   dreams   cutting foreign throats, 
  breaches, ambuscadoes, spanish blades, 
  healths five-fathom deep;   anon 
 drums   ear,    starts  wakes, 
    frighted swears a prayer   
  sleeps again.     mab 
  plats  manes  horses   night, 
  bakes  elflocks  foul sluttish hairs, 
   untangled,  misfortune bodes: 
    hag,  maids lie   backs, 
  presses   learns    bear, 
 making  women  good carriage: 
   she-- 
 romeo  peace, peace, mercutio, peace! 
 thou talk'st  nothing. 
 mercutio  true,  talk  dreams, 
    children   idle brain, 
 begot    vain fantasy, 
    thin  substance   air 
   inconstant   wind,  wooes 
    frozen bosom   north, 
 and,  anger'd, puffs   thence, 
 turning  face   dew-dropping south. 
 benvolio   wind,  talk of, blows   ourselves; 
 supper  done,      late. 
 romeo   fear,  early:   mind misgives 
  consequence  hanging   stars 
  bitterly   fearful date 
   night's revels  expire  term 
  a despised life closed   breast 
   vile forfeit  untimely death. 
  he,  hath  steerage   course, 
 direct  sail! on, lusty gentlemen. 
 benvolio  strike, drum.
