sonnet xiiisonnet xiiio,    yourself! but, love,  
 longer      live:
  coming    prepare,
  sweet semblance    give.
   beauty   hold  lease
find  determination:   
   yourself's decease,
  sweet issue  sweet form  bear.
 lets  fair a house fall  decay,
 husbandry  honour  uphold
  stormy gusts  winter's day
 barren rage  death's eternal cold?
o,   unthrifts! dear  love,  
  a father:   son  so.
