 enter  sheriff,  buckingham,  halberds, led  execution  buckingham    king richard   speak  him? 
 sheriff  no,  good lord;   patient. 
 buckingham  hastings,  edward's children, rivers, grey, 
 holy king henry,  thy fair son edward, 
 vaughan,     miscarried 
  underhand corrupted foul injustice, 
    moody discontented souls 
    clouds behold  present hour, 
   revenge mock  destruction! 
   all-souls' day, fellows,   not? 
 sheriff   is,  lord. 
 buckingham  why,  all-souls' day   body's doomsday. 
    day that,  king edward's time, 
  wish't  fall  me,     
 false   children   wife's allies 
    day   wish'd  fall 
   false faith    trusted most; 
 this,  all-souls' day   fearful soul 
   determined respite   wrongs: 
  high all-seer   dallied  
 hath turn'd  feigned prayer   head 
    earnest   begg'd  jest. 
  doth  force  swords  wicked men 
  turn   points   masters' bosoms: 
  margaret's curse  fallen   head; 
 ' he,' quoth she, ' split thy heart  sorrow, 
 remember margaret  a prophetess.' 
 come, sirs, convey    block  shame; 
 wrong hath  wrong,  blame  due  blame.
