sonnet lsonnet lhow heavy   journey   way,
   seek,  weary travel's end,
doth teach  ease   repose  
'   miles  measured  thy friend!'
 beast  bears me, tired   woe,
plods dully on,  bear  weight  me,
    instinct  wretch  
 rider loved  speed,    thee:
 bloody spur  provoke  
  anger thrusts   hide;
 heavily  answers  a groan,
 sharp    spurring   side;
   groan doth put    mind;
 grief lies onward   joy behind.
