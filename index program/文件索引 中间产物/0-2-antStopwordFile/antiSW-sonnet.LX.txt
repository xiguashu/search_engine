sonnet lxsonnet lxlike   waves    pebbled shore,
   minutes hasten   end;
 changing place     before,
 sequent toil  forwards  contend.
nativity,    main  light,
crawls  maturity, wherewith  crown'd,
crooked elipses 'gainst  glory fight,
 time  gave doth   gift confound.
time doth transfix  flourish set  youth
 delves  parallels  beauty's brow,
feeds   rarities  nature's truth,
  stands    scythe  mow:
   times  hope  verse  stand,
praising thy worth,   cruel hand.
