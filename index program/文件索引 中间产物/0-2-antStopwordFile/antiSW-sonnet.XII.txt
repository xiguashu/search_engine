sonnet xiisonnet xiiwhen   count  clock  tells  time,
   brave day sunk  hideous night;
  behold  violet  prime,
 sable curls  silver'd o'er  white;
 lofty trees   barren  leaves
 erst  heat  canopy  herd,
 summer's green  girded   sheaves
borne   bier  white  bristly beard,
  thy beauty   question make,
 thou   wastes  time  go,
 sweets  beauties   forsake
 die  fast     grow;
  'gainst time's scythe   defence
save breed,  brave    takes thee hence.
