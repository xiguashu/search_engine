sonnet xlsonnet xltake   loves,  love, yea,   all;
 hast thou    thou hadst before?
 love,  love,  thou mayst true love call;
   thine  thou hadst  more.
    love thou  love receivest,
  blame thee   love thou usest;
   blamed,  thou thyself deceivest
 wilful taste   thyself refusest.
  forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,
 thou steal thee   poverty;
 yet, love knows,   a greater grief
 bear love's wrong  hate's  injury.
lascivious grace,    ill  shows,
kill   spites;      foes.
