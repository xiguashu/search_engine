sonnet xlivsonnet xlivif  dull substance   flesh  thought,
injurious distance   stop  way;
    space    brought,
 limits  remote  thou dost stay.
 matter    foot  stand
  farthest earth removed  thee;
 nimble thought  jump  sea  land
     place    be.
 ah! thought kills      thought,
 leap large lengths  miles  thou art gone,
     earth  water wrought
  attend time's leisure   moan,
receiving nought  elements  slow
 heavy tears, badges  either's woe.
