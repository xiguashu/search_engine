sonnet xxiiisonnet xxiiias  unperfect actor   stage
   fear  put   part,
  fierce  replete    rage,
 strength's abundance weakens   heart.
 i,  fear  trust, forget  
 perfect ceremony  love's rite,
    love's strength   decay,
o'ercharged  burden    love's might.
o,   books    eloquence
 dumb presagers   speaking breast,
 plead  love    recompense
   tongue   hath  express'd.
o, learn  read  silent love hath writ:
 hear  eyes belongs  love's fine wit.
