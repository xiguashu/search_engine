sonnet lxisonnet lxiis  thy  thy image   open
 heavy eyelids   weary night?
dost thou desire  slumbers   broken,
 shadows   thee  mock  sight?
  thy spirit  thou send'st  thee
   home   deeds  pry,
 find  shames  idle hours  me,
 scope  tenor  thy jealousy?
o, no! thy love,  much,    great:
   love    eye awake;
  true love  doth  rest defeat,
 play  watchman   thy sake:
 thee watch   thou dost wake elsewhere,
   off,     near.
