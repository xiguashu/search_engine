sonnet xlvsonnet xlvthe  two, slight air  purging fire,
   thee,   abide;
   thought,    desire,
 present-absent  swift motion slide.
   quicker elements  
 tender embassy  love  thee,
 life,    four,   
sinks   death, oppress'd  melancholy;
 life's composition  recured
  swift messengers return'd  thee,
      again, assured
 thy fair health, recounting   me:
 told,  joy;    longer glad,
 send     straight grow sad.
