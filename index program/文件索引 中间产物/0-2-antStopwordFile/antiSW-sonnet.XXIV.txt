sonnet xxivsonnet xxivmine eye hath play'd  painter  hath stell'd
thy beauty's form  table   heart;
 body   frame  'tis held,
 perspective    painter's art.
   painter     skill,
 find   true image pictured lies;
   bosom's shop  hanging still,
 hath  windows glazed  thine eyes.
   good turns eyes  eyes  done:
 eyes  drawn thy shape,  thine  
 windows   breast, where-through  sun
delights  peep,  gaze   thee;
 eyes  cunning   grace  art;
 draw    see,    heart.
