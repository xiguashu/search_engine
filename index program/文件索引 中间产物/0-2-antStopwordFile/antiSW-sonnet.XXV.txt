sonnet xxvsonnet xxvlet     favour   stars
 public honour  proud titles boast,
 i,  fortune   triumph bars,
unlook'd  joy    honour most.
great princes' favourites  fair leaves spread
   marigold   sun's eye,
    pride lies buried,
  a frown    glory die.
 painful warrior famoused  fight,
 a thousand victories  foil'd,
   book  honour razed quite,
   rest forgot    toil'd:
 happy i,  love   beloved
    remove   removed.
