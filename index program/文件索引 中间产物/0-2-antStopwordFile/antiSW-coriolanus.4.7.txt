    |      vii. a camp,  a small distance  rome. 
 enter aufidius   lieutenant  aufidius     fly   roman? 
 lieutenant       witchcraft's  him,  
  soldiers     grace 'fore meat, 
  talk  table,     end; 
    darken'd   action, sir, 
    own. 
 aufidius      now, 
 unless,   means,  lame  foot 
   design.  bears   proudlier, 
    person,   thought   
     embrace him:   nature 
    changeling;    excuse 
    amended. 
 lieutenant    wish, sir,-- 
     particular,--you   
 join'd  commission  him;   
  borne  action  yourself,   
    left  solely. 
 aufidius   understand thee well;   thou sure, 
       account,    
    urge  him.   seems, 
    thinks,     apparent 
   vulgar eye,   bears   fairly. 
  shows good husbandry   volscian state, 
 fights dragon-like,   achieve   
  draw  sword;   hath left undone 
    break  neck  hazard mine, 
 whene'er     account. 
 lieutenant  sir,  beseech you,    carry rome? 
 aufidius   places yield   ere  sits down; 
   nobility  rome  his: 
  senators  patricians love  too: 
  tribunes   soldiers;   people 
    rash   repeal,  hasty 
  expel  thence.      rome 
    osprey   fish,  takes  
  sovereignty  nature.    
 a noble servant  them;     
 carry  honours even:  'twas pride, 
    daily fortune  taints 
  happy man;  defect  judgment, 
  fail   disposing   chances 
    lord of;   nature, 
       thing,  moving 
   casque   cushion,  commanding peace 
     austerity  garb 
   controll'd  war;    these-- 
   hath spices   all,  all, 
      free him--made  fear'd, 
  hated,   banish'd:    a merit, 
  choke    utterance.   virtues 
 lie   interpretation   time: 
  power,    commendable, 
 hath  a tomb  evident  a chair 
  extol   hath done. 
  fire drives   fire;  nail,  nail; 
 rights  rights falter, strengths  strengths  fail. 
 come,  away. when, caius, rome  thine, 
 thou art poor'st  all;  shortly art thou mine.
