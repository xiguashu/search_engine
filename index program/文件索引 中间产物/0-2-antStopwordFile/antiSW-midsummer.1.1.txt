 lysander  ay me!  aught     read, 
   hear  tale  history,

 but,      blood,-- 
 hermia  o cross!  high   enthrall'd  low. 
 lysander    misgraffed  respect  years,-- 
 hermia  o spite!     engaged  young. 
 lysander     stood   choice  friends,-- 
 hermia  o hell!  choose love  another's eyes. 
 lysander  or,    a sympathy  choice, 
 war, death,  sickness  lay siege  it, 
 making  momentany  a sound, 
 swift  a shadow, short   dream; 
    lightning   collied night, 
 that,  a spleen, unfolds  heaven  earth, 
  ere a  hath power   'behold!' 
  jaws  darkness  devour  up: 
  quick bright    confusion. 
 hermia    true lovers    cross'd, 
  stands   edict  destiny: 
    teach  trial patience, 
    a customary cross, 
  due  love  thoughts  dreams  sighs, 
 wishes  tears, poor fancy's followers. 
 lysander  a good persuasion: therefore, hear me, hermia. 
   a widow aunt, a dowager 
  great revenue,   hath  child:

   observance  a morn  may, 
    stay  thee. 
 hermia   good lysander! 
  swear  thee,  cupid's strongest bow, 
    arrow   golden head, 
   simplicity  venus' doves,

 lysander   promise, love. look,   helena. 

 enter helena  hermia  god speed fair helena!  away? 
 helena  call   fair?  fair  unsay. 
 demetrius loves  fair: o happy fair! 
  eyes  lode-stars;   tongue's sweet air 
  tuneable  lark  shepherd's ear, 
  wheat  green,  hawthorn buds appear. 
 sickness  catching: o,  favour so, 
    catch, fair hermia, ere  go; 
  ear  catch  voice,  eye  eye, 
  tongue  catch  tongue's sweet melody.

 hermia   frown  him,   loves  still. 
 helena  o   frowns  teach  smiles  skill! 
 hermia   give  curses,     love. 
 helena  o   prayers   affection move! 
 hermia     hate,     me. 
 helena     love,    hateth me. 
 hermia   folly, helena,   fault  mine. 
 helena  none,   beauty:   fault  mine! 
 hermia   comfort:       face; 
 lysander    fly  place. 
   time   lysander see, 
 seem'd athens  a paradise  me: 
 o, then,  graces   love  dwell, 
   hath turn'd a heaven  a hell! 
 lysander  helen,    minds   unfold: 
 to-morrow night,  phoebe doth behold 
  silver visage   watery glass, 
 decking  liquid pearl  bladed grass, 
 a time  lovers' flights doth  conceal, 
  athens' gates   devised  steal. 
 hermia     wood,      
  faint primrose-beds  wont  lie, 
 emptying  bosoms   counsel sweet, 
   lysander    meet; 
    athens turn   eyes, 
  seek  friends  stranger companies. 
 farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou  us; 
  good luck grant thee thy demetrius! 
  word, lysander:   starve  sight 
  lovers' food  morrow deep midnight. 
 lysander   will,  hermia. 

 exit hermia  helena, adieu: 
    him, demetrius dote  you! 

 exit  helena   happy  o'er    be! 
  athens   thought  fair  she. 
    that? demetrius thinks  so; 
          know: 
    errs, doting  hermia's eyes, 
  i, admiring   qualities: 
  base  vile, folding  quantity, 
 love  transpose  form  dignity: 
 love     eyes,    mind; 
    wing'd cupid painted blind: 
  hath love's mind   judgement taste; 
 wings   eyes figure unheedy haste: 
    love    a child, 
   choice    oft beguiled. 
  waggish boys  game  forswear, 
   boy love  perjured  where: 
  ere demetrius look'd  hermia's eyne, 
  hail'd  oaths     mine; 
    hail  heat  hermia felt, 
   dissolved,  showers  oaths  melt. 
       fair hermia's flight: 
    wood   to-morrow night 
 pursue her;    intelligence 
    thanks,   a dear expense: 
      enrich  pain, 
    sight thither   again.
