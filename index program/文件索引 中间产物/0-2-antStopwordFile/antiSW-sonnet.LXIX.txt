sonnet lxixsonnet lxixthose parts  thee   world's eye doth view
    thought  hearts  mend;
 tongues,  voice  souls, give thee  due,
uttering bare truth,    foes commend.
thy outward   outward praise  crown'd;
   tongues  give thee  thine 
  accents   praise confound
     eye hath shown.
    beauty  thy mind,
 that,  guess,  measure  thy deeds;
then, churls,  thoughts,   eyes  kind,
 thy fair flower add  rank smell  weeds:
  thy odour matcheth  thy show,
 solve  this,  thou dost common grow.
