 exeunt   gloucester  gloucester  ay, edward   women honourably. 
    wasted, marrow, bones  all, 
    loins  hopeful branch  spring, 
  cross    golden time   for! 
  yet,   soul's desire  me-- 
  lustful edward's title buried-- 
  clarence, henry,   son young edward, 
    unlook'd  issue   bodies, 
    rooms, ere   place myself: 
 a cold premeditation   purpose! 
 why, then,    dream  sovereignty; 
    stands  a promontory, 
  spies a far-off shore    tread, 
 wishing  foot  equal   eye, 
  chides  sea  sunders   thence, 
 saying,  lade  dry    way: 
      crown,    off; 
    chide  means     it; 
    say,  cut   off, 
 flattering   impossibilities. 
  eye's  quick,  heart o'erweens  much, 
   hand  strength  equal them. 
 well,     kingdom   richard; 
   pleasure   world afford? 
    heaven  a lady's lap, 
  deck  body  gay ornaments, 
  witch sweet ladies   words  looks. 
 o miserable thought!    
   accomplish twenty golden crowns! 
 why, love forswore     mother's womb: 
 and,     deal   soft laws, 
   corrupt frail nature   bribe, 
  shrink  arm   a wither'd shrub; 
    envious mountain   back, 
  sits deformity  mock  body; 
  shape  legs   unequal size; 
  disproportion    part, 
   a chaos,   unlick'd bear-whelp 
  carries  impression   dam. 
     a    beloved? 
 o monstrous fault,  harbour  a thought! 
 then,   earth affords  joy  me, 
   command,  cheque,  o'erbear  
     person  myself, 
    heaven  dream   crown, 
 and, whiles  live,  account  world  hell, 
   mis-shaped trunk  bears  head 
   impaled  a glorious crown. 
          crown, 
   lives stand    home: 
  i,--like  lost  a thorny wood, 
  rends  thorns   rent   thorns, 
 seeking a   straying   way; 
  knowing   find  open air, 
  toiling desperately  find  out,-- 
 torment   catch  english crown: 
    torment   free myself, 
  hew     a bloody axe. 
 why,   smile,  murder whiles  smile, 
  cry 'content'    grieves  heart, 
  wet  cheeks  artificial tears, 
  frame  face   occasions. 
  drown  sailors   mermaid shall; 
  slay  gazers   basilisk; 
  play  orator    nestor, 
 deceive  slily  ulysses could, 
 and,  a sinon,   troy. 
   add colours   chameleon, 
 change shapes  proteus  advantages, 
  set  murderous machiavel  school. 
    this,    a crown? 
 tut,    off,  pluck  down.
