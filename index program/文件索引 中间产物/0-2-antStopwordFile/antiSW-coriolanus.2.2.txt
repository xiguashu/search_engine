  senator  speak, good cominius: 
 leave    length,     
   state's defective  requital 
    stretch  out. 

   tribunes  masters o'  people, 
   request  kindest ears,  after, 
  loving motion   common body,

  senator  sit, coriolanus;  shame  hear 
    nobly done. 
 coriolanus   horror's pardon: 
      wounds  heal  
  hear     them. 
 brutus  sir,  hope 
  words disbench'd  not. 
 coriolanus  no, sir:  oft, 
  blows    stay,  fled  words. 
  soothed not,  hurt not:  
  people,

 cominius    lack voice:  deeds  coriolanus 
    utter'd feebly.   held 
  valour   chiefest virtue,  
  dignifies  haver:   be, 
    speak     world 
  singly counterpoised.  sixteen years, 
  tarquin  a head  rome,  fought 
   mark  others:   dictator, 
    praise  point at,   fight, 
    amazonian chin  drove 
  bristled lips  him:  bestrid 
  o'er-press'd roman  i'  consul's view 
 slew  opposers: tarquin's   met, 
  struck    knee:   day's feats, 
      woman   scene, 
  proved   i'  field,    meed 
  brow-bound   oak.  pupil age 
 man-enter'd thus,  waxed  a sea, 
    brunt  seventeen battles  
  lurch'd  swords   garland.   last, 
    corioli,   say, 
   speak  home:  stopp'd  fliers; 
    rare    coward 
 turn terror  sport:  weeds  
 a vessel  sail,  men obey'd 
  fell   stem:  sword, death's stamp, 
    mark,  took;  face  foot 
   a   blood,   motion 
  timed  dying cries:   enter'd 
  mortal gate   city,   painted 
  shunless destiny; aidless  off, 
   a sudden reinforcement struck 
 corioli  a planet:  all's his: 
 when,   by,  din  war gan pierce 
  ready sense;  straight  doubled spirit 
 re-quicken'd   flesh  fatigate, 
    battle  he;    
 run reeking o'er  lives  men,   
 'twere a perpetual spoil:    call'd

 menenius  worthy man!

   devise him. 
 cominius   spoils  kick'd at, 
  look'd   precious    
  common muck   world:  covets  
  misery   give; rewards 
  deeds   them,   content 
  spend  time   it.
