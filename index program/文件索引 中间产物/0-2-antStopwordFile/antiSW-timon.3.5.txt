 alcibiades   lord,--

 alcibiades   lords, then,  favour, pardon me,

  senator       plenty  'em;

   beseech you,  me. 
  senator  how! 
 alcibiades  call    remembrances. 
  senator  what! 
 alcibiades       age  forgot me;

  sue,   denied  common grace: 
  wounds ache  you. 
  senator      anger? 
 'tis   words,  spacious  effect; 
  banish thee  ever. 
 alcibiades  banish me! 
 banish  dotage; banish usury, 
    senate ugly. 
  senator  if,   days' shine, athens  thee, 
 attend  weightier judgment. and,   swell
