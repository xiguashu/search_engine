sonnet xxxiisonnet xxxiiif thou survive  well-contented day,
  churl death  bones  dust  cover,
 shalt  fortune   re-survey
 poor rude lines  thy deceased lover,
compare    bettering   time,
    outstripp'd   pen,
reserve    love,    rhyme,
exceeded   height  happier men.
o,  vouchsafe    loving thought:
'  friend's muse grown   growing age,
a dearer birth    love  brought,
 march  ranks   equipage:
   died  poets  prove,
   style  read,    love.'
