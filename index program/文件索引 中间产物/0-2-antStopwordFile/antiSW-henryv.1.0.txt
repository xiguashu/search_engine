    prologue 
 enter chorus  chorus  o  a muse  fire,   ascend 
  brightest heaven  invention, 
 a kingdom  a stage, princes   
  monarchs  behold  swelling scene! 
    warlike harry,  himself, 
 assume  port  mars;    heels, 
 leash'd   hounds,  famine, sword  fire 
 crouch  employment.  pardon,  gentles all, 
  flat unraised spirits   dared 
   unworthy scaffold  bring  
  great  object:   cockpit hold 
  vasty fields  france?    cram 
   wooden o   casques 
   affright  air  agincourt? 
 o, pardon!  a crooked figure  
 attest   place a million; 
   us, ciphers   great accompt, 
   imaginary forces work. 
 suppose   girdle   walls 
   confined  mighty monarchies, 
  high upreared  abutting fronts 
  perilous narrow ocean parts asunder: 
 piece   imperfections   thoughts; 
  a thousand parts divide  man, 
   imaginary puissance; 
    talk  horses,     
 printing  proud hoofs i'  receiving earth; 
  'tis  thoughts    deck  kings, 
 carry    there; jumping o'er times, 
 turning  accomplishment   years 
   hour-glass:    supply, 
 admit  chorus   history; 
  prologue-like  humble patience pray, 
 gently  hear, kindly  judge,  play.
