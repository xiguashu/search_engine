sonnet lxxxiisonnet lxxxiii grant thou wert  married   muse
  mayst  attaint o'erlook
 dedicated words  writers 
  fair subject, blessing  book
thou art  fair  knowledge   hue,
finding thy worth a limit   praise,
  art enforced  seek anew
 fresher stamp   time-bettering days
  so, love;     devised
 strained touches rhetoric  lend,
thou  fair wert  sympathized
 true plain words  thy true-telling friend;
  gross painting    
 cheeks  blood;  thee   abused.
