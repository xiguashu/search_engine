sonnet ciiisonnet ciiialack,  poverty  muse brings forth,
   a scope  show  pride,
 argument  bare    worth
   hath  added praise beside!
o, blame  not,      write!
   glass,   appears a face
 over-goes  blunt invention quite,
dulling  lines    disgrace.
   sinful then, striving  mend,
 mar  subject    well?
    pass  verses tend
   graces   gifts  tell;
 more,  more,    verse  sit
  glass shows      it.
