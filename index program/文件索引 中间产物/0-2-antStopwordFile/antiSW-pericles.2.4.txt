 enter helicanus  escanes  helicanus  no, escanes,    me, 
 antiochus  incest lived  free: 
  which,   high gods  minding longer 
  withhold  vengeance     store, 
 due   heinous capital offence, 
    height  pride    glory, 
    seated  a chariot 
   inestimable value,   daughter  him, 
 a fire  heaven   shrivell'd  
  bodies,   loathing;    stunk, 
    eyes adored  ere  fall 
 scorn   hand  give  burial. 
 escanes  'twas  strange. 
 helicanus     justice;   
  king  great,  greatness   guard 
  bar heaven's shaft,  sin   reward. 
 escanes  'tis  true. 

 enter    lords   lord  see,  a   private conference 
  council  respect    he. 
  lord     longer grieve  reproof. 
  lord   cursed       it. 
  lord  follow me, then. lord helicane, a word. 
 helicanus   me?  welcome: happy day,  lords. 
  lord     griefs  risen   top, 
    length  overflow  banks. 
 helicanus   griefs!  what? wrong   prince  love. 
  lord  wrong  yourself, then, noble helicane; 
    prince  live,   salute him, 
    ground's  happy   breath. 
    world  live,  seek  out; 
    grave  rest,  find  there; 
   resolved  lives  govern us, 
  dead, give's   mourn  funeral, 
  leave    free election. 
  lord   death indeed's  strongest   censure: 
  knowing  kingdom   a head,-- 
  goodly buildings left  a roof 
  fall  ruin,--your noble self, 
      rule    reign, 
   submit unto,--our sovereign. 
   live, noble helicane! 
 helicanus   honour's cause, forbear  suffrages: 
    love prince pericles, forbear. 
    wish,  leap   seas, 
  hourly trouble  a minute's ease. 
 a twelvemonth longer,   entreat   
 forbear  absence   king: 
    time expired,   return, 
    aged patience bear  yoke. 
     win    love, 
  search  nobles,  noble subjects, 
    search spend  adventurous worth; 
    find,  win  return, 
    diamonds sit   crown. 
  lord   wisdom  a fool    yield; 
   lord helicane enjoineth us, 
    travels  endeavour us. 
 helicanus    love us,  you,   clasp hands: 
  peers  knit, a kingdom  stands.
