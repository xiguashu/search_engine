sonnet ciisonnet ciimy love  strengthen'd,   weak  seeming;
 love  less,    show appear:
 love  merchandized  rich esteeming
 owner's tongue doth publish  where.
 love        spring
   wont  greet    lays,
 philomel  summer's front doth sing
 stops  pipe  growth  riper days:
   summer   pleasant 
   mournful hymns  hush  night,
  wild music burthens  bough
 sweets grown common lose  dear delight.
     hold  tongue,
    dull    song.
