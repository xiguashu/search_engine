sonnet livsonnet livo,    doth beauty beauteous 
  sweet ornament  truth doth give!
 rose  fair,  fairer   deem
  sweet odour  doth   live.
 canker-blooms  full  deep a dye
  perfumed tincture   roses,
hang   thorns  play  wantonly
 summer's breath  masked buds discloses:
but,   virtue    show,
 live unwoo'd  unrespected fade,
die  themselves. sweet roses   so;
  sweet deaths  sweetest odours made:
   you, beauteous  lovely youth,
   fade,  verse distills  truth.
