sonnet xcvsonnet xcvhow sweet  lovely dost thou   shame
which,  a canker   fragrant rose,
doth spot  beauty  thy budding name!
o,   sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!
 tongue  tells  story  thy days,
making lascivious comments  thy sport,
 dispraise   a kind  praise;
naming thy  blesses  ill report.
o,  a mansion   vices 
   habitation chose  thee,
 beauty's veil doth cover  blot,
   turn  fair  eyes  see!
 heed, dear heart,   large privilege;
 hardest knife ill-used doth lose  edge.
