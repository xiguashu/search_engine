 sprung   rancorous outrage   duke 
  merchants,  well-dealing countrymen, 
  wanting guilders  redeem  lives 
  seal'd  rigorous statutes   bloods, 
 excludes  pity   threatening looks. 
 for,   mortal  intestine jars 
 'twixt thy seditious countrymen  us, 
  hath  solemn synods  decreed 
    syracusians  ourselves, 
  admit  traffic   adverse towns nay, more,

  thou departed'st  thy native home 
     thou camest  ephesus. 
 aegeon  a heavier task     imposed

 yet,   world  witness    
  wrought  nature,   vile offence, 
  utter   sorrows give  leave. 
  syracusa   born,  wed 
  a woman, happy   me, 
   me,    hap  bad. 
    lived  joy;  wealth increased 
  prosperous voyages    
  epidamnum;   factor's death 
   great care  goods  random left 
 drew   kind embracements   spouse: 
    absence    months  
  herself,   fainting  
  pleasing punishment  women bear, 
   provision     
    safe arrived   was. 
      long,    
 a joyful mother   goodly sons; 
 and,   strange,      other, 
     distinguish'd   names. 
   hour,    self-same inn, 
 a meaner woman  delivered 
   a burden, male twins,  alike: 
 those,--for  parents  exceeding poor,-- 
  bought  brought   attend  sons. 
  wife,  meanly proud    boys, 
  daily motions   home return: 
 unwilling  agreed. alas!  soon, 
   aboard. 
 a league  epidamnum   sail'd, 
    wind-obeying deep 
 gave  tragic instance   harm: 
  longer    retain  hope; 
   obscured light  heavens  grant 
   convey   fearful minds 
 a doubtful warrant   death; 
     gladly  embraced, 
   incessant weepings   wife, 
 weeping       come, 
  piteous plainings   pretty babes, 
  mourn'd  fashion, ignorant   fear, 
 forced   seek delays    me. 
    was,   means  none: 
  sailors sought  safety   boat, 
  left  ship,  sinking-ripe,  us: 
  wife,  careful   latter-born, 
  fasten'd   a small spare mast, 
   seafaring men provide  storms; 
       twins  bound, 
      heedful   other: 
  children  disposed,  wife  i, 
 fixing  eyes    care  fix'd, 
 fasten'd      mast; 
  floating straight, obedient   stream, 
  carried  corinth,   thought. 
  length  sun, gazing   earth, 
 dispersed  vapours  offended us; 
    benefit   wished light, 
  seas wax'd calm,   discovered 
  ships   making amain  us, 
  corinth that,  epidaurus this: 
  ere  came,--o,     more! 
 gather  sequel    before. 
 duke solinus  nay, forward,  man;   break  so; 
    pity,   pardon thee. 
 aegeon  o,   gods  so,     
 worthily term'd  merciless  us! 
 for, ere  ships  meet    leagues, 
   encounterd  a mighty rock; 
   violently borne upon, 
  helpful ship  splitted   midst; 
  that,   unjust divorce  us, 
 fortune  left     alike 
   delight in,   sorrow for. 
  part, poor soul!   burdened 
  lesser weight    lesser woe, 
  carried   speed   wind; 
    sight      
  fishermen  corinth,   thought. 
  length,  ship  seized  us; 
 and, knowing     hap  save, 
 gave healthful    shipwreck'd guests; 
    reft  fishers   prey, 
    bark   slow  sail; 
   homeward   bend  course. 
    heard  sever'd   bliss; 
   misfortunes   life prolong'd, 
   sad stories    mishaps. 
 duke solinus     sake   thou sorrowest for, 
    favour  dilate  full 
  hath befall'n    thee  now. 
 aegeon   youngest boy,    eldest care, 
  eighteen years  inquisitive

    labour'd  a love  see, 
  hazarded  loss    loved. 
  summers   spent  furthest greece, 
 roaming clean   bounds  asia, 
 and, coasting homeward,   ephesus; 
 hopeless  find,  loath  leave unsought 
     place  harbours men. 
      story   life; 
  happy     timely death, 
    travels warrant   live. 
 duke solinus  hapless aegeon,   fates  mark'd 
  bear  extremity  dire mishap! 
 now, trust me,      laws, 
   crown,  oath,  dignity, 
  princes,  they,   disannul, 
  soul  sue  advocate  thee. 
 but,  thou art adjudged   death 
  passed sentence    recall'd 
    honour's great disparagement, 
    favour thee    can. 
 therefore, merchant,  limit thee  day 
  seek thy life  beneficial help: 
    friends thou hast  ephesus; 
 beg thou,  borrow,     sum, 
  live;  no,  thou art doom'd  die.
