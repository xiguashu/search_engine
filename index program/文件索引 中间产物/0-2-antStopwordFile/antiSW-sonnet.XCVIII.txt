sonnet xcviiisonnet xcviiifrom     absent   spring,
 proud-pied april dress'd    trim
hath put a spirit  youth   thing,
 heavy saturn laugh'd  leap'd  him.
   lays  birds   sweet smell
  flowers  odour   hue
    summer's story tell,
   proud lap pluck    grew;
      lily's white,
 praise  deep vermilion   rose;
   sweet,  figures  delight,
drawn  you,  pattern   those.
 seem'd  winter still, and,  away,
   shadow     play:
