    |      vi.  part   field. 
 alarums. enter king henry  forces, exeter,    king henry      done, thrice valiant countrymen: 
  all's  done;    french  field. 
 exeter   duke  york commends    majesty. 
 king henry   lives he, good uncle? thrice   hour 
    down; thrice    fighting; 
  helmet   spur  blood  was. 
 exeter    array, brave soldier, doth  lie, 
 larding  plain;    bloody side, 
 yoke-fellow   honour-owing wounds, 
  noble earl  suffolk  lies. 
 suffolk  died:  york,  haggled over, 
   him,   gore  lay insteep'd, 
  takes    beard; kisses  gashes 
  bloodily  spawn   face; 
  cries aloud 'tarry, dear cousin suffolk! 
  soul  thine  company  heaven; 
 tarry, sweet soul,  mine,  fly abreast, 
    glorious  well-foughten field 
      chivalry!' 
   words    cheer'd  up: 
  smiled    face, raught   hand, 
 and,  a feeble gripe,  'dear  lord, 
 commend  service   sovereign.' 
    turn   suffolk's neck 
  threw  wounded arm  kiss'd  lips; 
   espoused  death,  blood  seal'd 
 a testament  noble-ending love. 
  pretty  sweet manner   forced 
  waters       stopp'd; 
          me, 
    mother    eyes 
  gave    tears. 
 king henry    blame  not; 
 for, hearing this,   perforce compound 
  mistful eyes,    issue too. 

 alarum  but, hark!   alarum   same? 
  french  reinforced  scatter'd men: 
   soldier kill  prisoners: 
 give  word through.
