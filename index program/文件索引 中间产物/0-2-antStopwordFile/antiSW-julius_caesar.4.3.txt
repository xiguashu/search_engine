  sell  mart  offices  gold 
  undeservers. 
 cassius    itching palm! 
      brutus  speak this, 
 or,   gods,  speech    last. 
 brutus     cassius honours  corruption, 
  chastisement doth  hide  head. 
 cassius  chastisement! 
 brutus  remember march,  ides  march remember: 
   great julius bleed  justice' sake?

 cassius   wrong   way;  wrong me, brutus; 
  said,  elder soldier,  a better: 
    'better'?

    raise  money  vile means: 
  heaven,    coin  heart, 
  drop  blood  drachmas,   wring 
   hard hands  peasants  vile trash 
   indirection:   send 
    gold  pay  legions, 
   denied me:     cassius? 
    answer'd caius cassius so? 
  marcus brutus grows  covetous, 
  lock  rascal counters   friends, 
  ready, gods,    thunderbolts; 
 dash   pieces! 
 cassius   denied  not. 
 brutus   did. 
 cassius    not:    a fool  brought 
  answer back. brutus hath rived  heart:

 cheque'd  a bondman;   faults observed, 
 set  a note-book, learn'd,  conn'd  rote, 
  cast   teeth. o,   weep

    will, dishonour   humour. 
 o cassius,   yoked  a lamb 
  carries anger   flint bears fire; 
 who,  enforced, shows a hasty spark, 
  straight  cold again. 
 cassius  hath cassius lived

  grief  young octavius  mark antony 
     strong:--for   death 
  tidings came;--with   fell distract, 
 and,  attendants absent, swallow'd fire. 
 cassius   died so? 
 brutus   so. 
 cassius  o ye immortal gods! 

 re-enter lucius,  wine  taper  brutus  speak    her. give  a bowl  wine. 
    bury  unkindness, cassius. 
 cassius   heart  thirsty   noble pledge. 
 fill, lucius,   wine o'erswell  cup; 
   drink    brutus' love. 
 brutus   in, titinius! 

 exit lucius 
 re-enter titinius,  messala  welcome, good messala. 
  sit  close   taper here, 
  call  question  necessities. 
 cassius  portia, art thou gone? 
 brutus   more,  pray you. 
 messala,    received letters, 
  young octavius  mark antony 
      a mighty power, 
 bending  expedition  philippi. 
 messala    letters   selfsame tenor. 
 brutus    addition? 
 messala    proscription  bills  outlawry, 
 octavius, antony,  lepidus, 
  put  death   senators. 
 brutus    letters    agree; 
  speak  seventy senators  died 
   proscriptions, cicero  one. 
 cassius  cicero one! 
 messala  cicero  dead, 
    order  proscription. 
    letters   wife,  lord? 
 brutus  no, messala. 
 messala      letters writ  her? 
 brutus  nothing, messala. 
 messala  that, methinks,  strange. 
 brutus    you? hear  aught    yours? 
 messala  no,  lord. 
 brutus  now,    a roman,   true. 
 messala    a roman bear  truth  tell:

 cassius         art  you, 
    nature   bear  so. 
 brutus  well,   work alive.     
  marching  philippi presently? 
 cassius       good. 
 brutus   reason? 
 cassius    is: 
 'tis    enemy seek us: 
    waste  means, weary  soldiers, 
   offence;  we, lying still, 
  full  rest, defense,  nimbleness. 
 brutus  good reasons must,  force, give place  better. 
  people 'twixt philippi   ground 
  stand   a forced affection; 
    grudged  contribution: 
  enemy, marching   them, 
     a fuller number up, 
   refresh'd, new-added,  encouraged; 
   advantage   cut  off, 
   philippi   face  there, 
  people   back. 
 cassius  hear me, good brother. 
 brutus    pardon.   note beside, 
      utmost   friends, 
  legions  brim-full,    ripe: 
  enemy increaseth  day; 
 we,   height,  ready  decline. 
   a tide   affairs  men, 
 which,    flood, leads   fortune; 
 omitted,   voyage   life 
  bound  shallows   miseries. 
   a full sea    afloat; 
      current   serves, 
  lose  ventures. 
 cassius  then,   will,  on; 
   ourselves,  meet   philippi. 
 brutus   deep  night  crept   talk, 
  nature  obey necessity; 
    niggard  a  rest. 
      say? 
 cassius   more. good night: 
 early to-morrow   rise,  hence.
