sonnet cviiisonnet cviiiwhat's   brain  ink  character
 hath  figured  thee  true spirit?
   speak,    register,
  express  love  thy dear merit?
nothing, sweet boy;  yet,  prayers divine,
 must,  day  o'er   same,
counting    old, thou mine,  thine,
     hallow'd thy fair name.
  eternal love  love's fresh case
weighs   dust  injury  age,
    wrinkles place,
  antiquity  aye  page,
finding   conceit  love  bred
 time  outward form  show  dead.
