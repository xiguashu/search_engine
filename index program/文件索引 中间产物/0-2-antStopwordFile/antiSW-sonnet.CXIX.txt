sonnet cxixsonnet cxixwhat potions   drunk  siren tears,
distill'd  limbecks foul  hell within,
applying fears  hopes  hopes  fears,
 losing      win!
 wretched errors hath  heart committed,
  hath thought   blessed never!
   eyes    spheres  fitted
  distraction   madding fever!
o benefit  ill!   find true
    evil   better;
 ruin'd love,    built anew,
grows fairer   first,  strong,  greater.
  return rebuked   content
 gain  ill thrice     spent.
