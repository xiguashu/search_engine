  measure kingdoms   feeble steps; 
      hath love's wings  fly, 
    flight      dear, 
   divine perfection,  sir proteus. 
 lucetta   forbear  proteus  return. 
 julia  o, know'st thou      soul's food?

 julia    thou damm'st  up,    burns. 
  current   gentle murmur glides, 
 thou know'st,  stopp'd, impatiently doth rage; 
    fair    hindered, 
   sweet music   enamell'ed stones, 
 giving a gentle kiss   sedge 
  overtaketh   pilgrimage, 
     winding nooks  strays 
   sport   wild ocean.

 julia    a woman;    prevent 
  loose encounters  lascivious men: 
 gentle lucetta, fit    weeds 
   beseem  well-reputed page. 
 lucetta  why, then,  ladyship  cut  hair.

  tears pure messengers    heart, 
  heart    fraud  heaven  earth. 
 lucetta  pray heaven  prove so,     him!

  goods,  lands,  reputation; 
 only,  lieu thereof, dispatch  hence. 
 come, answer not,    presently! 
   impatient   tarriance.
