 enter suffolk  conference  king henry vi, gloucester  exeter  king henry vi   wondrous rare description, noble earl, 
  beauteous margaret hath astonish'd me: 
  virtues graced  external gifts 
  breed love's settled passions   heart: 
    rigor  tempestuous gusts 
 provokes  mightiest hulk   tide, 
    driven  breath   renown 
   suffer shipwreck  arrive 
     fruition   love. 
 suffolk  tush,  good lord,  superficial tale 
   a preface   worthy praise; 
  chief perfections   lovely dame 
   sufficient skill  utter them, 
   a volume  enticing lines, 
   ravish  dull conceit: 
 and,   more,     divine, 
  full-replete  choice   delights, 
    humble lowliness  mind 
   content     command; 
 command,  mean,  virtuous chaste intents, 
  love  honour henry   lord. 
 king henry vi     henry ne'er presume. 
 therefore,  lord protector, give consent 
  margaret   england's royal queen. 
 gloucester     give consent  flatter sin. 
  know,  lord,  highness  betroth'd 
   lady  esteem: 
     dispense   contract, 
   deface  honour  reproach? 
 suffolk   doth a ruler  unlawful oaths; 
   that,  a triumph  vow'd 
    strength, forsaketh   lists 
  reason   adversary's odds: 
 a poor earl's daughter  unequal odds, 
     broke  offence. 
 gloucester  why, what,  pray,  margaret   that? 
  father      earl, 
   glorious titles  excel.

      abject, base  poor, 
  choose  wealth    perfect love. 
 henry    enrich  queen 
   seek a queen    rich: 
  worthless peasants bargain   wives, 
  market-men  oxen, sheep,  horse. 
 marriage  a matter   worth 
    dealt   attorneyship;

   companion   nuptial bed: 
  therefore, lords,   affects  most, 
      reasons bindeth us, 
   opinions    preferr'd. 
    wedlock forced  a hell, 
  age  discord  continual strife? 
   contrary bringeth bliss, 
   a pattern  celestial peace. 
    match  henry,  a king, 
  margaret,   daughter  a king? 
  peerless feature, joined   birth, 
 approves  fit     a king: 
  valiant courage  undaunted spirit, 
    women commonly  seen, 
  answer  hope  issue  a king;

    beget  conquerors, 
   a lady   high resolve 
   fair margaret   link'd  love.
