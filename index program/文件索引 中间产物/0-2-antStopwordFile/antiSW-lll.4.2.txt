 enter holofernes, sir nathaniel,  dull  sir nathaniel   reverend sport, truly;     testimony 
  a good conscience. 
 holofernes   deer was,   know, sanguis,  blood; ripe 
   pomewater,   hangeth  a jewel  
  ear  caelo,  sky,  welkin,  heaven; 
  anon falleth  a crab   face  terra, 
  soil,  land,  earth. 
 sir nathaniel  truly, master holofernes,  epithets  sweetly 
 varied,  a scholar   least: but, sir,  
 assure ye,   a buck    head. 
 holofernes  sir nathaniel, haud credo. 
 dull  'twas  a haud credo; 'twas a pricket. 
 holofernes   barbarous intimation!  a kind  
 insinuation,   were,  via,  way,  
 explication; facere,   were, replication,  
 rather, ostentare,  show,   were,  
 inclination,   undressed, unpolished, 
 uneducated, unpruned, untrained,  rather, 
 unlettered,  ratherest, unconfirmed fashion,  
 insert   haud credo  a deer. 
 dull     deer   a haud credo; twas a pricket. 
 holofernes  twice-sod simplicity,  coctus! 
 o thou monster ignorance,  deformed dost thou look! 
 sir nathaniel  sir,  hath  fed   dainties   bred 
  a book;  hath  eat paper,   were;  
 hath  drunk ink:  intellect   
 replenished;     animal,    
  duller parts: 
   barren plants  set  us,   
 thankful  be, 
    taste  feeling are,   parts  
  fructify     he. 
     ill     vain, indiscreet,  a fool, 
    a patch set  learning,     a school: 
  omne bene,  i;     father's mind, 
   brook  weather  love   wind. 
 dull     book-men:       wit 
   a month   cain's birth,    
 weeks   yet? 
 holofernes  dictynna, goodman dull; dictynna, goodman dull. 
 dull    dictynna? 
 sir nathaniel  a title  phoebe,  luna,   moon. 
 holofernes   moon  a month   adam   more, 
  raught    weeks     
 five-score. 
  allusion holds   exchange. 
 dull  'tis true indeed;  collusion holds   exchange. 
 holofernes  god comfort thy capacity!  say,  allusion holds 
   exchange. 
 dull    say,  pollusion holds   exchange;  
  moon    a month old:     
 that, 'twas a pricket   princess killed. 
 holofernes  sir nathaniel,   hear  extemporal epitaph 
   death   deer? and,  humour  
 ignorant, call   deer  princess killed a pricket. 
 sir nathaniel  perge, good master holofernes, perge;    
    abrogate scurrility. 
 holofernes     affect  letter,   argues facility. 
  preyful princess pierced  prick'd a pretty 
 pleasing pricket; 
   a sore;   a sore,    
 sore  shooting. 
  dogs  yell: put l  sore,  sorel jumps 
  thicket; 
  pricket sore,   sorel;  people fall a-hooting. 
  sore  sore,  l  sore  fifty sores 
  sorel. 
   sore      adding    l. 
 sir nathaniel  a rare talent! 
 dull  [aside]   a talent  a claw,    claws 
   a talent. 
 holofernes    a gift   have, simple, simple; a 
 foolish extravagant spirit, full  forms, figures, 
 shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions, 
 revolutions:   begot   ventricle  
 memory, nourished   womb  pia mater,  
 delivered   mellowing  occasion.   
 gift  good       acute,    
 thankful  it. 
 sir nathaniel  sir,  praise  lord  you;     
 parishioners;   sons   tutored  
 you,   daughters profit  greatly  
 you:   a good member   commonwealth. 
 holofernes  mehercle,   sons  ingenuous,   
   instruction;   daughters  capable, 
   put   them:  vir sapit qui pauca 
 loquitur; a soul feminine saluteth us.

 holofernes  master parson, quasi pers-on.      
 pierced,    one? 
 costard  marry, master schoolmaster,    likest  a hogshead. 
 holofernes  piercing a hogshead! a good lustre  conceit  a 
 tuft  earth; fire   a flint, pearl  
  a swine: 'tis pretty;   well. 
 jaquenetta  good master parson,   good  read

 sir nathaniel  [reads] 
  love   forsworn,    swear  love? 
 ah,  faith  hold,    beauty vow'd! 
    forsworn,  thee  faithful prove: 
  thoughts    oaks,  thee  
 osiers bow'd. 
 study  bias leaves    book thine eyes, 
    pleasures live  art  
 comprehend: 
  knowledge   mark,   thee  suffice; 
  learned   tongue    thee commend, 
  ignorant  soul  sees thee  wonder; 
      praise   thy parts admire: 
 thy eye jove's lightning bears, thy voice  dreadful thunder, 
    anger bent,  music  sweet fire. 
 celestial  thou art, o, pardon, love,  wrong, 
  sings heaven's praise    earthly tongue. 
 holofernes   find   apostraphas,     
 accent:   supervise  canzonet.   
  numbers ratified; but,   elegancy, 
 facility,  golden cadence  poesy, caret. 
 ovidius naso   man:  why, indeed, naso, 
   smelling   odouriferous flowers  
 fancy,  jerks  invention? imitari  nothing: 
  doth  hound  master,  ape  keeper, 
  tired horse  rider. but, damosella virgin,
