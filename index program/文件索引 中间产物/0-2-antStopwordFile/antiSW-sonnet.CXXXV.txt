sonnet cxxxvsonnet cxxxvwhoever hath  wish, thou hast thy 'will,'
 'will'  boot,  'will'  overplus;
      vex thee still,
 thy sweet  making addition thus.
wilt thou,    large  spacious,
  vouchsafe  hide    thine?
      gracious,
     fair acceptance shine?
 sea  water,  receives rain 
  abundance addeth   store;
 thou,  rich  'will,' add  thy 'will'
   mine,   thy large 'will' more.
  unkind,  fair beseechers kill;
   one,      'will.'
