sonnet iiisonnet iiilook  thy glass,    face thou viewest
   time  face  form another;
 fresh repair   thou  renewest,
thou dost beguile  world, unbless  mother.
     fair  unear'd womb
disdains  tillage  thy husbandry?
     fond    tomb
  self-love,  stop posterity?
thou art thy mother's glass,    thee
calls   lovely april   prime:
 thou  windows  thine age  
  wrinkles  thy golden time.
  thou live, remember'd   be,
die single,  thine image dies  thee.
