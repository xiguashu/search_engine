 clapp'd   outward eye  fickle france, 
 hath drawn     determined aid, 
  a resolved  honourable war, 
  a  base  vile-concluded peace. 
   rail    commodity? 
     hath  woo'd  yet: 
      power  clutch  hand, 
   fair angels  salute  palm; 
    hand,  unattempted yet, 
  a poor beggar, raileth   rich. 
 well, whiles   a beggar,   rail 
      sin    rich; 
   rich,  virtue    
      vice  beggary. 
  kings break faith  commodity, 
 gain,   lord,    worship thee.
