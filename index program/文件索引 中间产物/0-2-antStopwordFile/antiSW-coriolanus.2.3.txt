   beat water brought  conduits hither; 
   [censorinus,]  nobly named so, 
    [  people chosen]  censor, 
   great ancestor. 
 sicinius    descended, 
  hath     person wrought 
   set high  place,   commend 
   remembrances:    found, 
 scaling  present bearing   past, 
    fixed enemy,  revoke 
  sudden approbation. 
 brutus  say,  ne'er  done't-- 
 harp   still--but   putting on; 
  presently,    drawn  number, 
 repair   capitol. 
     so:   
 repent   election. 

 exeunt citizens  brutus     on; 
  mutiny   put  hazard, 
  stay,  doubt,  greater:
