sonnet xlixsonnet xlixagainst  time,    time come,
    thee frown   defects,
  thy love hath cast  utmost sum,
call'd   audit  advised respects;
  time  thou shalt strangely pass
 scarcely greet    sun thine eye,
 love, converted     was,
 reasons find  settled gravity,--
  time   ensconce  
  knowledge    desert,
   hand   uprear,
 guard  lawful reasons  thy part:
 leave poor  thou hast  strength  laws,
   love   allege  cause.
