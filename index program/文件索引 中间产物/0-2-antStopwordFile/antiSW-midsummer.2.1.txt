    |      i. a wood  athens. 
 enter,   sides, a fairy,  puck  puck   now, spirit!  wander you? 
 fairy   hill,  dale, 
  bush,  brier, 
  park,  pale, 
  flood,  fire, 
   wander everywhere, 
 swifter   moon's sphere; 
   serve  fairy queen, 
  dew  orbs   green. 
  cowslips tall  pensioners be: 
   gold coats spots  see; 
   rubies, fairy favours, 
   freckles live  savours: 
    seek  dewdrops  
  hang a pearl   cowslip's ear. 
 farewell, thou lob  spirits;   gone: 
  queen    elves   anon. 
 puck   king doth   revels  to-night: 
  heed  queen     sight; 
  oberon  passing fell  wrath, 
      attendant hath 
 a lovely boy, stolen   indian king; 
     sweet a changeling; 
  jealous oberon    child 
 knight   train,  trace  forests wild; 
   perforce withholds  loved boy, 
 crowns   flowers      joy: 
     meet  grove  green, 
  fountain clear,  spangled starlight sheen, 
 but,   square,    elves  fear 
 creep  acorn-cups  hide  there. 
 fairy    mistake  shape  making quite, 
      shrewd  knavish sprite 
 call'd robin goodfellow:     
  frights  maidens   villagery; 
 skim milk,   labour   quern 
  bootless   breathless housewife churn; 
     drink  bear  barm; 
 mislead night-wanderers, laughing   harm? 
   hobgoblin call   sweet puck, 
    work,     good luck: 
    he? 
 puck  thou speak'st aright; 
    merry wanderer   night. 
  jest  oberon    smile 
   a fat  bean-fed horse beguile, 
 neighing  likeness  a filly foal: 
   lurk   a gossip's bowl, 
   likeness  a roasted crab, 
    drinks,   lips  bob 
    wither'd dewlap pour  ale. 
  wisest aunt, telling  saddest tale, 
   three-foot stool mistaketh me; 
  slip    bum,  topples she, 
  'tailor' cries,  falls  a cough; 
     quire hold  hips  laugh, 
  waxen   mirth  neeze  swear 
 a merrier hour   wasted there. 
 but, room, fairy!   oberon. 
 fairy     mistress.     gone! 

 enter,   side, oberon,   train;   other, titania,    oberon  ill met  moonlight, proud titania. 
 titania  what, jealous oberon! fairies, skip hence: 
   forsworn  bed  company. 
 oberon  tarry, rash wanton:    thy lord? 
 titania      thy lady:    
  thou hast stolen   fairy land, 
    shape  corin sat  day, 
 playing  pipes  corn  versing love 
  amorous phillida.  art thou here, 
    farthest steppe  india? 
  that, forsooth,  bouncing amazon, 
  buskin'd mistress   warrior love, 
  theseus   wedded,    
  give  bed joy  prosperity. 
 oberon   canst thou   shame, titania, 
 glance   credit  hippolyta, 
 knowing   thy love  theseus? 
 didst thou  lead    glimmering night 
  perigenia,   ravished? 
     fair aegle break  faith, 
  ariadne  antiopa? 
 titania     forgeries  jealousy: 
  never,   middle summer's spring, 
 met   hill,  dale, forest  mead, 
  paved fountain   rushy brook, 
    beached margent   sea, 
  dance  ringlets   whistling wind, 
   thy brawls thou hast disturb'd  sport. 
   winds, piping    vain, 
   revenge,  suck'd    sea 
 contagious fogs;  falling   land 
   pelting river   proud 
    overborne  continents: 
  ox hath  stretch'd  yoke  vain, 
  ploughman lost  sweat,   green corn 
 hath rotted ere  youth attain'd a beard; 
  fold stands empty   drowned field, 
  crows  fatted   murrion flock; 
   men's morris  fill'd   mud, 
   quaint mazes   wanton green 
  lack  tread  undistinguishable: 
  human mortals   winter here; 
  night    hymn  carol blest: 
   moon,  governess  floods, 
 pale   anger, washes   air, 
  rheumatic diseases  abound: 
    distemperature   
  seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts 
    fresh lap   crimson rose, 
    hiems' thin  icy crown 
  odorous chaplet  sweet summer buds 
 is,   mockery, set:  spring,  summer, 
  childing autumn, angry winter, change 
  wonted liveries,   mazed world, 
   increase,      which: 
    progeny  evils  
   debate,   dissension; 
    parents  original. 
 oberon    amend  then;  lies  you: 
   titania cross  oberon? 
    beg a  changeling boy, 
    henchman. 
 titania  set  heart  rest: 
  fairy land buys   child  me. 
  mother  a votaress   order: 
 and,   spiced indian air,  night, 
 full  hath  gossip'd   side, 
  sat    neptune's yellow sands, 
 marking  embarked traders   flood, 
    laugh'd    sails conceive 
  grow big-bellied   wanton wind; 
  she,  pretty   swimming gait 
 following,--her womb  rich   young squire,-- 
  imitate,  sail   land, 
  fetch  trifles,  return again, 
   a voyage, rich  merchandise. 
  she,  mortal,   boy  die; 
    sake   rear   boy, 
    sake    part  him. 
 oberon   long   wood intend  stay? 
 titania  perchance   theseus' wedding-day. 
    patiently dance    
    moonlight revels,   us; 
  not, shun me,    spare  haunts. 
 oberon  give   boy,      thee. 
 titania    thy fairy kingdom. fairies, away! 
   chide downright,   longer stay. 

 exit titania   train  oberon  well,  thy way: thou shalt    grove 
   torment thee   injury. 
  gentle puck,  hither. thou rememberest 
    sat  a promontory, 
  heard a mermaid  a dolphin's  
 uttering  dulcet  harmonious breath 
   rude sea grew civil   song 
   stars shot madly   spheres, 
  hear  sea-maid's music. 
 puck   remember. 
 oberon    time  saw,  thou couldst not, 
 flying   cold moon   earth, 
 cupid  arm'd: a  aim   
  a fair vestal throned   west, 
  loosed  love-shaft smartly   bow, 
    pierce a  thousand hearts; 
     young cupid's fiery shaft 
 quench'd   chaste beams   watery moon, 
   imperial votaress passed on, 
  maiden meditation, fancy-free. 
  mark'd    bolt  cupid fell: 
  fell  a  western flower, 
  milk-white,  purple  love's wound, 
  maidens call  love-in-idleness. 
 fetch   flower;  herb  shew'd thee once: 
  juice    sleeping eye-lids laid 
      woman madly dote 
    live creature   sees. 
 fetch   herb;   thou   
 ere  leviathan  swim a league. 
 puck   put a girdle    earth 
  forty minutes. 

 exit  oberon     juice, 
  watch titania    asleep, 
  drop  liquor     eyes. 
      waking  upon, 
    lion, bear,  wolf,  bull, 
  meddling monkey,   busy ape, 
   pursue    soul  love: 
  ere    charm    sight, 
        herb, 
    render   page  me. 
    here?   invisible; 
    overhear  conference. 

 enter demetrius, helena,    demetrius   love thee not,  pursue  not. 
   lysander  fair hermia? 
    slay,   slayeth me. 
 thou told'st    stolen   wood; 
    i,  wode   wood, 
    meet  hermia. 
 hence,  thee gone,  follow   more. 
 helena   draw me,  hard-hearted adamant; 
    draw  iron,   heart 
  true  steel: leave   power  draw, 
      power  follow you. 
 demetrius    entice you?   speak  fair? 
 or, rather,     plainest truth 
  you,   not,    love you? 
 helena        love   more. 
    spaniel; and, demetrius, 
    beat me,   fawn  you: 
      spaniel, spurn me, strike me, 
 neglect me, lose me;  give  leave, 
 unworthy   am,  follow you. 
  worser place   beg   love,-- 
   a place  high respect  me,-- 
         dog? 
 demetrius  tempt     hatred   spirit; 
    sick      thee. 
 helena     sick      you. 
 demetrius    impeach  modesty  much, 
  leave  city  commit  
   hands    loves  not; 
  trust  opportunity  night 
   ill counsel  a desert place 
   rich worth   virginity. 
 helena   virtue   privilege:   
    night      face, 
         night; 
  doth  wood lack worlds  company, 
     respect    world: 
         alone, 
    world      me? 
 demetrius   run  thee  hide    brakes, 
  leave thee   mercy  wild beasts. 
 helena   wildest hath   a heart  you. 
 run   will,  story   changed: 
 apollo flies,  daphne holds  chase; 
  dove pursues  griffin;  mild hind 
  speed  catch  tiger; bootless speed, 
  cowardice pursues  valour flies. 
 demetrius     stay thy questions;   go: 
 or,  thou follow me,    
     thee mischief   wood. 
 helena  ay,   temple,   town,  field, 
    mischief. fie, demetrius! 
  wrongs  set a scandal   sex: 
   fight  love,  men  do; 
    wood      woo.

  die   hand  love  well. 

 exit  oberon  fare thee well, nymph: ere   leave  grove, 
 thou shalt fly     seek thy love. 

 re-enter puck  hast thou  flower there? welcome, wanderer. 
 puck  ay,   is. 
 oberon   pray thee, give  me. 
   a bank   wild thyme blows, 
  oxlips   nodding violet grows, 
  over-canopied  luscious woodbine, 
  sweet musk-roses   eglantine: 
  sleeps titania    night, 
 lull'd   flowers  dances  delight; 
    snake throws  enamell'd skin, 
 weed wide   wrap a fairy in: 
    juice    streak  eyes, 
    full  hateful fantasies. 
  thou   it,  seek   grove: 
 a sweet athenian lady   love 
  a disdainful youth: anoint  eyes; 
         espies 
    lady: thou shalt    
   athenian garments  hath on. 
 effect    care,    prove 
  fond       love: 
   thou meet  ere   cock crow. 
 puck  fear not,  lord,  servant   so.
