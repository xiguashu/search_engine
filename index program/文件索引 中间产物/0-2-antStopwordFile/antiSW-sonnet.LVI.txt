sonnet lvisonnet lvisweet love, renew thy force;    
thy edge  blunter   appetite,
  to-day  feeding  allay'd,
to-morrow sharpen'd    might:
so, love,  thou;  to-day thou fill
thy hungry eyes    wink  fullness,
to-morrow  again,    kill
 spirit  love  a perpetual dullness.
  sad interim   ocean 
 parts  shore,   contracted 
 daily   banks, that,   
return  love,  blest    view;
 call  winter,   full  care
 summer's  thrice  wish'd,  rare.
