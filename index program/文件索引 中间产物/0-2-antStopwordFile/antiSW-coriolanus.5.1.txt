     general;  loved  
  a  dear particular.  call'd  father: 
   o' that? go,   banish'd him; 
 a mile   tent fall down,  knee 
     mercy: nay,   coy'd 
  hear cominius speak,    home.

 cominius    time   call    name: 
  urged   acquaintance,   drops 
    bled together. coriolanus 
    answer to: forbad  names; 
   a kind  nothing, titleless, 
    forged  a  o'  fire 
  burning rome. 
 menenius  why, so:    good work! 
 a pair  tribunes   rack'd  rome, 
   coals cheap,--a noble memory! 
 cominius   minded   royal 'twas  pardon 
     expected:  replied, 
   a bare petition  a state 
      punish'd. 
 menenius   well: 
    less? 
 cominius   offer'd  awaken  regard 
 for's private friends:  answer   was, 
    stay  pick   a pile 
  noisome musty chaff:   'twas folly, 
   poor grain  two,  leave unburnt, 
    nose  offence. 
 menenius    poor grain  two! 
     those;  mother, wife,  child, 
   brave fellow too,    grains:

   intended well. 
 menenius   undertake 't: 
    hear me. yet,  bite  lip 
  hum  good cominius,  unhearts me. 
     well;    dined: 
  veins unfill'd,  blood  cold,   
  pout   morning,  unapt 
  give   forgive;     stuff'd 
    conveyances   blood 
  wine  feeding,   suppler souls 
    priest-like fasts:   watch  
    dieted   request, 
    set  him. 
 brutus      road   kindness, 
   lose  way. 
 menenius  good faith,  prove him, 
 speed   will.   ere long  knowledge 
   success. 

 exit  cominius    hear him. 
 sicinius  not? 
 cominius    you,   sit  gold,  eye 
 red  'twould burn rome;   injury 
  gaoler   pity.  kneel'd  him; 
 'twas  faintly   'rise;' dismiss'd  
 thus,   speechless hand:    do, 
    writing  me;    not, 
 bound   oath  yield   conditions: 
    hope  vain. 
   noble mother,   wife; 
 who,   hear,   solicit  
  mercy   country. therefore,  hence, 
    fair entreaties haste  on.
