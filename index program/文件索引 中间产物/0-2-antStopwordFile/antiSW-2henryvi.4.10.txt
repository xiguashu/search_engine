 enter cade  cade  fie  ambition! fie  myself,   a sword, 
    ready  famish!   days   
 hid    woods  durst  peep out,  
   country  laid  me;      
 hungry      a lease   life  a 
 thousand years   stay  longer. wherefore, 
  a brick wall   climbed   garden,  
     eat grass,  pick a sallet  
 while,    amiss  cool a man's stomach 
  hot weather.     word 'sallet' 
  born    good:   a time,   a 
 sallet,  brainpan   cleft  a brown 
 bill;   a time,     dry  
 bravely marching,  hath served    a 
 quart pot  drink in;    word 'sallet' 
  serve   feed on. 

 enter iden  iden  lord,   live turmoiled   court, 
   enjoy  quiet walks  these? 
  small inheritance  father left  
 contenteth me,  worth a monarchy.

  gather wealth,  care not,   envy: 
 sufficeth    maintains  state 
  sends  poor  pleased   gate.

 stray,  entering  fee-simple  leave. 
 ah, villain, thou wilt betray me,   a thousand 
 crowns   king carrying  head  him:  
   thee eat iron   ostrich,  swallow 
  sword  a great pin, ere thou   part. 
 iden  why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be, 
   thee not; why, then,   betray thee?

 and,  a thief,    rob  grounds, 
 climbing  walls  spite    owner, 
  thou wilt brave    saucy terms? 
 cade  brave thee! ay,    blood    
 broached,  beard thee too.    well:  
  eat  meat   days; yet,  thou  
 thy  men,      leave    dead 
  a doornail,  pray god    eat grass more.

  alexander iden,  esquire  kent, 
  odds  combat a poor famish'd man. 
 oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes  mine, 
   thou canst outface   thy looks: 
 set limb  limb,  thou art   lesser; 
 thy hand   a finger   fist, 
 thy leg a stick compared   truncheon; 
  foot  fight    strength thou hast; 
    arm  heaved   air, 
 thy grave  digg'd    earth. 
   words,  greatness answers words, 
    sword report  speech forbears.

 heard! steel,  thou turn  edge,  cut   
  burly-boned clown  chines  beef ere thou 
 sleep  thy sheath,  beseech god   knees thou 
 mayst  turned  hobnails.

  ten thousand devils   me,  give  
   ten meals   lost,   defy  
 all. wither, garden;   henceforth a 
 burying-place     dwell   house, 
   unconquered soul  cade  fled. 
 iden  is't cade    slain,  monstrous traitor? 
 sword,   hollow thee   thy deed, 
  hang thee o'er  tomb    dead: 
 ne'er   blood  wiped  thy point; 
  thou shalt wear   a herald's coat, 
  emblaze  honour  thy master got. 
 cade  iden, farewell,   proud  thy victory.  
 kent  me,  hath lost   man,  exhort 
   world   cowards;  i,   
 feared any,  vanquished  famine,   valour. 

 dies  iden    thou wrong'st me, heaven   judge. 
 die, damned wretch,  curse    bare thee; 
    thrust thy body    sword, 
   i,   thrust thy soul  hell. 
    drag thee headlong   heels 
  a dunghill    thy grave, 
   cut  thy  ungracious head; 
    bear  triumph   king, 
 leaving thy trunk  crows  feed upon.
