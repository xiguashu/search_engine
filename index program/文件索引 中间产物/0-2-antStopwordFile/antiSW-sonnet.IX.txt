sonnet ixsonnet ixis   fear  wet a widow's eye
 thou consumest thyself  single life?
ah!  thou issueless shalt hap  die.
 world  wail thee,  a makeless wife;
 world   thy widow   weep
 thou  form  thee hast left behind,
  private widow   
 children's eyes  husband's shape  mind.
look,   unthrift   world doth spend
shifts   place,    world enjoys it;
 beauty's waste hath   world  end,
  unused,  user  destroys it.
 love     bosom sits
    murderous shame commits.
