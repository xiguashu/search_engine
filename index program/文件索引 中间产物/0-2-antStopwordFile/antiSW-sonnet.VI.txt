sonnet visonnet vithen   winter's ragged hand deface
 thee thy summer, ere thou  distill'd:
 sweet  vial; treasure thou  place
 beauty's treasure, ere   self-kill'd.
    forbidden usury,
 happies   pay   loan;
  thyself  breed  thee,
 ten times happier,   ten  one;
ten times thyself  happier  thou art,
 ten  thine ten times refigured thee:
   death do,  thou shouldst depart,
leaving thee living  posterity?
  self-will'd,  thou art   fair
  death's conquest   worms thine heir.
