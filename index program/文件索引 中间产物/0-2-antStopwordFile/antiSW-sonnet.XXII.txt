sonnet xxiisonnet xxiimy glass   persuade    old,
 long  youth  thou    date;
   thee time's furrows  behold,
   death  days  expiate.
   beauty  doth cover thee
   seemly raiment   heart,
  thy breast doth live,  thine  me:
     elder  thou art?
o, therefore, love,   thyself  wary
 i,   myself,   thee will;
bearing thy heart,      chary
 tender nurse  babe  faring ill.
presume   thy heart    slain;
thou gavest  thine,   give  again.
