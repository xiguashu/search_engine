 cried hate  him;    prayers  love 
  set  hereford,   doted  
  bless'd  graced indeed,    king. 
    mere digression   purpose. 
      princely general 
    griefs;      grace 
    give  audience;   
      demands  just, 
   enjoy them,   set  
        enemies. 
 mowbray    hath forced   compel  offer; 
   proceeds  policy,  love. 
 westmoreland  mowbray,  overween    so; 
  offer   mercy,   fear: 
 for, lo!  a ken  army lies, 
   honour,   confident 
  give admittance  a thought  fear.

      offer  compell'd. 
 mowbray  well,      admit  parley. 
 westmoreland   argues   shame   offence: 
 a rotten case abides  handling. 
 hastings  hath  prince john a full commission, 
   ample virtue   father, 
  hear  absolutely  determine 
   conditions   stand upon? 
 westmoreland    intended   general's name: 
  muse    slight a question. 
 archbishop  york   take,  lord  westmoreland,  schedule, 
     general grievances: 
   article  redress'd, 
  members   cause,    hence, 
   insinew'd   action, 
 acquitted  a true substantial form 
  present execution   wills 
      purposes confined, 
     awful banks  
  knit  powers   arm  peace. 
 westmoreland     show  general.  you, lords, 
  sight    battles   meet; 
     peace,  god  frame! 
    place  difference call  swords 
   decide it. 
 archbishop  york   lord,    so. 

 exit westmoreland  mowbray    a    bosom tells  
   conditions   peace  stand. 
 hastings  fear   that:      peace 
   large terms   absolute 
   conditions  consist upon, 
  peace  stand  firm  rocky mountains. 
 mowbray  yea,   valuation    
   slight  false-derived cause, 
 yea,  idle, nice  wanton reason 
    king taste   action; 
 that,   royal faiths martyrs  love, 
    winnow'd   rough a wind 
    corn    light  chaff 
  good  bad find  partition. 
 archbishop  york  no, no,  lord. note this;  king  weary 
  dainty   picking grievances: 
   hath     doubt  death 
 revives  greater   heirs  life, 
     wipe  tables clean 
    tell-tale   memory 
   repeat  history  loss 
   remembrance;  full    
    precisely weed  land 
   misdoubts present occasion: 
  foes   enrooted   friends 
 that, plucking  unfix  enemy, 
  doth unfasten   shake a friend: 
    land,   offensive wife 
  hath enraged    offer strokes, 
    striking, holds  infant  
  hangs resolved correction   arm 
   uprear'd  execution. 
 hastings  besides,  king hath wasted   rods 
  late offenders,    doth lack 
   instruments  chastisement: 
    power,   a fangless lion, 
  offer,   hold. 
 archbishop  york  'tis  true: 
    assured,  good lord marshal, 
       atonement well, 
  peace will,  a broken limb united, 
 grow stronger   breaking. 
 mowbray    so. 
   return'd  lord  westmoreland. 

 re-enter westmoreland  westmoreland   prince    hand: pleaseth  lordship 
  meet  grace  distance 'tween  armies. 
 mowbray   grace  york,  god's  then, set forward. 
 archbishop  york  before,  greet  grace:  lord,  come.
