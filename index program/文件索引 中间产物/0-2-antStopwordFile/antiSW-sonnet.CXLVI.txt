sonnet cxlvisonnet cxlvipoor soul,  centre   sinful earth,
[         ]  rebel powers  thee array;
 dost thou pine   suffer dearth,
painting thy outward walls  costly gay?
  large cost,   short a lease,
dost thou  thy fading mansion spend?
 worms, inheritors   excess,
eat  thy charge?   thy body's end?
 soul, live thou  thy servant's loss,
   pine  aggravate thy store;
buy terms divine  selling hours  dross;
  fed,   rich  more:
 shalt thou feed  death,  feeds  men,
 death  dead,    dying then.
