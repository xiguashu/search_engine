sonnet lisonnet lithus   love excuse  slow offence
  dull bearer   thee  speed:
  thou art    haste  thence?
  return,  posting   need.
o,  excuse   poor beast  find,
 swift extremity    slow?
   spur,  mounted   wind;
 winged speed  motion   know:
   horse   desire  pace;
 desire  perfect'st love  made,
 neigh--no dull flesh--in  fiery race;
 love,  love,   excuse  jade;
  thee    wilful-slow,
 thee  run,  give  leave  go.
