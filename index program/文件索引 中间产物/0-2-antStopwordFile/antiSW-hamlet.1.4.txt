 horatio     lacks  twelve. 
 hamlet  no,   struck. 
 horatio  indeed?  heard  not:   draws   season 
   spirit held  wont  walk. 

 a flourish  trumpets,  ordnance shot off,      mean,  lord? 
 hamlet   king doth wake to-night  takes  rouse, 
  wassail,   swaggering up-spring reels; 
 and,   drains  draughts  rhenish down, 
  kettle-drum  trumpet  bray  
  triumph   pledge. 
 horatio    a custom? 
 hamlet  ay, marry, is't: 
    mind,    native  
    manner born,   a custom 
  honour'd   breach   observance. 
  heavy-headed revel east  west 
   traduced  tax'd   nations: 
  clepe  drunkards,   swinish phrase 
 soil  addition;    takes

  thy canonized bones, hearsed  death, 
  burst  cerements;   sepulchre, 
    thee quietly inurn'd, 
 hath oped  ponderous  marble jaws, 
  cast thee  again.    mean, 
  thou, dead corse,   complete steel 
 revisit'st   glimpses   moon, 
 making night hideous;   fools  nature 
  horridly  shake  disposition
