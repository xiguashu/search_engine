    |      i. mantua. a street. 
 enter romeo  romeo     trust  flattering truth  sleep, 
  dreams presage  joyful news  hand: 
  bosom's lord sits lightly   throne; 
    day  unaccustom'd spirit 
 lifts    ground  cheerful thoughts. 
  dreamt  lady     dead-- 
 strange dream,   a dead  leave 
  think!-- 
  breathed  life  kisses   lips, 
   revived,    emperor. 
 ah me!  sweet  love  possess'd, 
   love's shadows   rich  joy! 

 enter balthasar, booted  news  verona!--how now, balthasar! 
 dost thou  bring  letters   friar? 
  doth  lady?   father well? 
  fares  juliet?    again; 
     ill,    well. 
 balthasar     well,     ill: 
  body sleeps  capel's monument, 
   immortal part  angels lives. 
    laid    kindred's vault, 
  presently  post    you: 
 o, pardon   bringing  ill news, 
    leave    office, sir. 
 romeo     so?   defy you, stars! 
 thou know'st  lodging:   ink  paper, 
  hire post-horses;    to-night. 
 balthasar    beseech you, sir,  patience: 
    pale  wild,   import 
  misadventure. 
 romeo  tush, thou art deceived: 
 leave me,      bid thee do. 
 hast thou  letters     friar? 
 balthasar  no,  good lord. 
 romeo   matter:  thee gone, 
  hire  horses;    thee straight. 

 exit balthasar  well, juliet,   lie  thee to-night. 
    means: o mischief, thou art swift 
  enter   thoughts  desperate men! 
   remember  apothecary,-- 
  hereabouts  dwells,--which late  noted 
  tatter'd weeds,  overwhelming brows, 
 culling  simples; meagre   looks, 
 sharp misery  worn    bones: 
    needy shop a tortoise hung, 
  alligator stuff'd,   skins 
  ill-shaped fishes;    shelves 
 a beggarly account  empty boxes, 
 green earthen pots, bladders  musty seeds, 
 remnants  packthread   cakes  roses, 
  thinly scatter'd,    a show. 
 noting  penury,     
 '  a    a poison now, 
  sale  present death  mantua, 
  lives a caitiff wretch  sell  him.' 
 o,   thought   forerun  need; 
    needy   sell  me. 
   remember,     house. 
  holiday,  beggar's shop  shut. 
 what, ho! apothecary! 

 enter apothecary  apothecary   calls  loud? 
 romeo   hither, man.    thou art poor: 
 hold,   forty ducats:    
 a dram  poison,  soon-speeding gear 
   disperse     veins 
   life-weary taker  fall dead 
    trunk   discharged  breath 
  violently  hasty powder fired 
 doth hurry   fatal cannon's womb. 
 apothecary   mortal drugs  have;  mantua's law 
  death     utters them. 
 romeo  art thou  bare  full  wretchedness, 
  fear'st  die? famine   thy cheeks, 
   oppression starveth  thine eyes, 
 contempt  beggary hangs  thy back; 
  world   thy friend   world's law; 
  world affords  law   thee rich; 
    poor,  break it,   this. 
 apothecary   poverty,    will, consents. 
 romeo   pay thy poverty,   thy will. 
 apothecary  put    liquid   will, 
  drink  off; and,     strength 
  twenty men,   dispatch  straight. 
 romeo    thy gold, worse poison  men's souls, 
   murders   loathsome world, 
   poor compounds  thou mayst  sell. 
  sell thee poison; thou hast sold  none. 
 farewell: buy food,   thyself  flesh. 
 come, cordial   poison,    
  juliet's grave;      thee.
