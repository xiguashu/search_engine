  crept   bosom   sea; 
   loud-howling wolves arouse  jades 
  drag  tragic melancholy night; 
 who,   drowsy, slow  flagging wings, 
 clip dead men's graves    misty jaws 
 breathe foul contagious darkness   air. 
  bring   soldiers   prize; 
 for,   pinnace anchors   downs,

 thy   gaultier,  rightly sounded. 
 whitmore  gaultier  walter,   is,  care not: 
    base dishonour blur  name, 
    sword  wiped   blot; 
 therefore,  merchant-like  sell revenge, 
 broke   sword,  arms torn  defaced, 
   proclaim'd a coward   world! 
 suffolk  stay, whitmore;  thy prisoner  a prince, 
  duke  suffolk, william de la pole. 
 whitmore   duke  suffolk muffled   rags! 
 suffolk  ay,   rags   part   duke:

 thy lips  kiss'd  queen  sweep  ground; 
  thou  smiledst  good duke humphrey's death, 
   senseless winds shalt grin  vain, 
   contempt  hiss  thee again: 
  wedded  thou   hags  hell, 
  daring  affy a mighty lord 
   daughter  a worthless king, 
   subject, wealth,  diadem. 
  devilish policy art thou grown great, 
 and,  ambitious sylla, overgorged 
  gobbets  thy mother's bleeding heart. 
  thee anjou  maine  sold  france, 
  false revolting normans  thee 
 disdain  call  lord,  picardy 
 hath slain  governors, surprised  forts, 
    ragged soldiers wounded home. 
  princely warwick,   nevils all, 
  dreadful swords   drawn  vain, 
  hating thee,  rising   arms: 
    house  york, thrust   crown 
  shameful murder  a guiltless king 
  lofty proud encroaching tyranny, 
 burns  revenging fire;  hopeful colours 
 advance  half-faced sun, striving  shine, 
     writ 'invitis nubibus.' 
  commons   kent    arms: 
 and,  conclude, reproach  beggary 
  crept   palace   king. 
    thee. away! convey  hence. 
 suffolk  o    a god,  shoot  thunder 
   paltry, servile, abject drudges! 
 small   base men proud:  villain here, 
  captain  a pinnace, threatens  
  bargulus  strong illyrian pirate. 
 drones suck  eagles' blood  rob beehives: 
   impossible    die
