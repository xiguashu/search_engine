sonnet cxlsonnet cxlbe wise  thou art cruel;   press
 tongue-tied patience    disdain;
 sorrow lend  words  words express
 manner   pity-wanting pain.
   teach thee wit,   were,
   love, yet, love,    so;
 testy sick men,   deaths  near,
 news  health   physicians know;
    despair,   grow mad,
   madness  speak ill  thee:
  ill-wresting world  grown  bad,
mad slanderers  mad ears believed be,
     so,  thou belied,
bear thine eyes straight,  thy proud heart  wide.
