    |      v. dunsinane.   castle. 
 enter macbeth, seyton,  soldiers,  drum  colours  macbeth  hang   banners   outward walls; 
  cry   ' come:'  castle's strength 
  laugh a siege  scorn:    lie 
  famine   ague eat  up: 
    forced      ours, 
    met  dareful, beard  beard, 
  beat   home. 

 a cry  women      noise? 
 seyton     cry  women,  good lord. 

 exit  macbeth     forgot  taste  fears; 
  time  been,  senses   cool'd 
  hear a night-shriek;   fell  hair 
   a dismal treatise rouse  stir 
  life  in't:   supp'd full  horrors; 
 direness, familiar   slaughterous thoughts 
   start me. 

 re-enter seyton  wherefore   cry? 
 seyton   queen,  lord,  dead. 
 macbeth     died hereafter; 
     a time   a word. 
 to-morrow,  to-morrow,  to-morrow, 
 creeps   petty pace  day  day 
    syllable  recorded time, 
    yesterdays  lighted fools 
    dusty death. out, out,  candle! 
 life's  a walking shadow, a poor player 
  struts  frets  hour   stage 
    heard  more:   a tale 
 told   idiot, full  sound  fury, 
 signifying nothing. 

 enter a messenger  thou comest   thy tongue; thy story quickly. 
 messenger  gracious  lord, 
   report      saw, 
       it. 
 macbeth  well, say, sir. 
 messenger     stand  watch   hill, 
  look'd  birnam,  anon, methought, 
  wood began  move. 
 macbeth  liar  slave! 
 messenger    endure  wrath, if't   so: 
    mile     coming; 
  say, a moving grove. 
 macbeth   thou speak'st false, 
    tree shalt thou hang alive, 
  famine cling thee:  thy speech  sooth, 
  care   thou dost    much. 
  pull  resolution,   
  doubt  equivocation   fiend 
  lies  truth: 'fear not,  birnam wood 
    dunsinane:'    a wood 
   dunsinane. arm, arm,  out! 
     avouches  appear, 
    flying   tarrying here. 
  gin   aweary   sun, 
    estate o'  world   undone. 
 ring  alarum-bell! blow, wind! come, wrack! 
    die  harness   back.
