 enter aaron,  a bag  gold  aaron     wit      none, 
  bury   gold  a tree, 
     inherit it. 
    thinks    abjectly 
    gold  coin a stratagem, 
 which, cunningly effected,  beget 
 a  excellent piece  villany: 
   repose, sweet gold,   unrest 

 hides  gold     alms    empress' chest. 

 enter tamora  tamora   lovely aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad, 
    doth  a gleeful boast? 
  birds chant melody   bush, 
  snake lies rolled   cheerful sun, 
  green leaves quiver   cooling wind 
   a chequer'd shadow   ground: 
   sweet shade, aaron,   sit, 
 and,   babbling echo mocks  hounds, 
 replying shrilly   well-tuned horns, 
   a double hunt  heard  once, 
   sit   mark  yelping noise; 
 and,  conflict    supposed 
  wandering prince  dido  enjoy'd, 
   a happy storm   surprised 
  curtain'd  a counsel-keeping cave, 
  may,  wreathed   other's arms, 
  pastimes done, possess a golden slumber; 
 whiles hounds  horns  sweet melodious birds 
      a nurse's song 
  lullaby  bring  babe asleep. 
 aaron  madam,  venus govern  desires, 
 saturn  dominator  mine: 
  signifies  deadly-standing eye, 
  silence   cloudy melancholy, 
  fleece  woolly hair   uncurls 
    adder   doth unroll 
    fatal execution? 
 no, madam,    venereal signs: 
 vengeance    heart, death   hand, 
 blood  revenge  hammering   head. 
 hark tamora,  empress   soul, 
   hopes  heaven  rests  thee, 
    day  doom  bassianus: 
  philomel  lose  tongue to-day, 
 thy sons  pillage   chastity 
  wash  hands  bassianus' blood. 
 seest thou  letter?   up,  pray thee, 
  give  king  fatal plotted scroll. 
  question   more;   espied; 
   a parcel   hopeful booty, 
  dreads    lives' destruction. 
 tamora  ah,  sweet moor, sweeter    life! 
 aaron   more, great empress; bassianus comes: 
  cross  him;    fetch thy sons 
   thy quarrels, whatsoe'er  be. 

 exit 
 enter bassianus  lavinia  bassianus     here? rome's royal empress, 
 unfurnish'd   well-beseeming troop? 
    dian, habited  her, 
  hath abandoned  holy groves 
    general hunting   forest? 
 tamora  saucy controller   private steps! 
    power    dian had, 
 thy temples   planted presently 
  horns,   actaeon's;   hounds 
  drive  thy new-transformed limbs, 
 unmannerly intruder  thou art! 
 lavinia    patience, gentle empress, 
 'tis thought   a goodly gift  horning; 
    doubted   moor   
  singled    experiments: 
 jove shield  husband   hounds to-day! 
 'tis pity      a stag. 
 bassianus   me, queen,  swarth cimmerian 
 doth   honour   body's hue, 
 spotted, detested,  abominable. 
    sequester'd    train, 
 dismounted   snow-white goodly steed. 
  wander'd    obscure plot, 
 accompanied   a barbarous moor, 
  foul desire   conducted you? 
 lavinia  and,  intercepted   sport, 
 great reason   noble lord  rated 
  sauciness.  pray you,   hence, 
    joy  raven-colour'd love; 
  valley fits  purpose passing well. 
 bassianus   king  brother   note  this. 
 lavinia  ay,   slips    noted long: 
 good king,    mightily abused! 
 tamora     patience  endure  this? 

 enter demetrius  chiron  demetrius   now, dear sovereign,   gracious mother! 
  doth  highness   pale  wan? 
 tamora     reason,  you,   pale? 
    'ticed     place: 
 a barren detested vale,    is; 
  trees,  summer,  forlorn  lean, 
 o'ercome  moss  baleful mistletoe: 
   shines  sun;   breeds, 
   nightly owl  fatal raven: 
    show'd   abhorred pit, 
  told me, here,  dead time   night, 
 a thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes, 
 ten thousand swelling toads,   urchins, 
    fearful  confused cries 
   mortal body hearing  
  straight fall mad,   die suddenly. 
  sooner   told  hellish tale, 
  straight  told    bind   
   body  a dismal yew, 
  leave    miserable death: 
    call'd  foul adulteress, 
 lascivious goth,    bitterest terms 
   ear  hear   effect: 
 and,     wondrous fortune come, 
  vengeance     executed. 
 revenge it,   love  mother's life, 
   ye  henceforth call'd  children. 
 demetrius    a witness    thy son. 

 stabs bassianus  chiron     me, struck home  show  strength. 

  stabs bassianus,  dies  lavinia  ay, come, semiramis, nay, barbarous tamora, 
    fits thy nature  thy own! 
 tamora  give  thy poniard;   know,  boys 
  mother's hand    mother's wrong. 
 demetrius  stay, madam;    belongs  her; 
  thrash  corn,   burn  straw: 
  minion stood   chastity, 
   nuptial vow,  loyalty, 
    painted hope braves  mightiness: 
    carry    grave? 
 chiron     do,      eunuch. 
 drag   husband   secret hole, 
    dead trunk pillow   lust. 
 tamora    ye   honey ye desire, 
    wasp outlive,    sting. 
 chiron   warrant you, madam,  wil l   sure. 
 come, mistress,  perforce   enjoy 
  nice-preserved honesty  yours. 
 lavinia  o tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face,-- 
 tamora     hear  speak;   her! 
 lavinia  sweet lords, entreat  hear   a word. 
 demetrius  listen, fair madam:     glory 
    tears;    heart   
  unrelenting flint  drops  rain. 
 lavinia     tiger's young  teach  dam? 
 o,   learn  wrath;  taught  thee; 
  milk thou suck'dst    turn  marble; 
   thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny. 
   mother breeds  sons alike: 

  chiron   thou entreat  show a woman pity. 
 chiron  what, wouldst thou   prove  a bastard? 
 lavinia  'tis true;  raven doth  hatch a lark: 
    heard,--o,   find  now!-- 
  lion moved  pity  endure 
    princely paws pared  away: 
    ravens foster forlorn children, 
     birds famish   nests: 
 o,   me,  thy hard heart  no, 
   kind,   pitiful! 
 tamora       means;   her! 
 lavinia  o,   teach thee!   father's sake, 
  gave thee life,      
 slain thee, 
   obdurate, open thy deaf ears. 
 tamora  hadst thou  person ne'er offended me, 
    sake   pitiless. 
 remember, boys,  pour'd  tears  vain, 
  save  brother   sacrifice; 
  fierce andronicus   relent; 
 therefore,   her,      will, 
  worse  her,   loved  me. 
 lavinia  o tamora,  call'd a gentle queen, 
   thine  hands kill    place! 
  'tis  life    begg'd  long; 
 poor   slain  bassianus died. 
 tamora   begg'st thou, then? fond woman,   go. 
 lavinia  'tis present death  beg;     
  womanhood denies  tongue  tell: 
 o,     worse  killing lust, 
  tumble    loathsome pit, 
   man's eye  behold  body: 
  this,   a charitable murderer. 
 tamora     rob  sweet sons   fee: 
 no,   satisfy  lust  thee. 
 demetrius  away!  thou hast stay'd    long. 
 lavinia   grace?  womanhood? ah, beastly creature! 
  blot  enemy   general name! 
 confusion fall-- 
 chiron  nay,   stop  mouth. bring thou  husband: 
    hole  aaron bid  hide him. 

 demetrius throws  body  bassianus    pit;  exeunt demetrius  chiron, dragging  lavinia  tamora  farewell,  sons:      sure. 
 ne'er   heart  merry cheer indeed, 
    andronici   away. 
      seek  lovely moor, 
    spleenful sons  trull deflow'r. 

 exit 
 re-enter aaron,  quintus  martius  aaron   on,  lords,   foot before: 
 straight   bring    loathsome pit 
   espied  panther fast asleep.

    leave  sport  sleep awhile. 

 falls   pit  quintus   art thou fall'n?  subtle hole  this, 
  mouth  cover'd  rude-growing briers, 
   leaves  drops  new-shed blood 
  fresh  morning dew distill'd  flowers? 
 a  fatal place    me.

 martius  o brother,   dismall'st object hurt 
   eye  sight  heart lament! 
 aaron  [aside]     fetch  king  find  here, 
     give a  guess 
         brother. 

 exit  martius   dost  comfort me,     
   unhallowed  blood-stained hole? 
 quintus    surprised   uncouth fear; 
 a chilling sweat o'er-runs  trembling joints: 
  heart suspects    eye  see.

 aaron  thou     den, 
   a fearful sight  blood  death.

   permit  eyes   behold 
   whereat  trembles  surmise; 
 o,     is;  ne'er   
   a child  fear    what. 
 martius  lord bassianus lies embrewed here, 
   a heap,   a slaughter'd lamb, 
   detested, dark, blood-drinking pit. 
 quintus     dark,  dost thou  'tis he? 
 martius    bloody finger  doth wear 
 a precious ring,  lightens   hole, 
 which,  a taper   monument, 
 doth shine   dead man's earthy cheeks, 
  shows  ragged entrails   pit: 
  pale  shine  moon  pyramus 
    night lay bathed  maiden blood. 
 o brother,    thy fainting hand-- 
  fear hath  thee faint,    hath-- 
    fell devouring receptacle, 
  hateful  cocytus' misty mouth. 
 quintus  reach  thy hand,     thee out; 
 or, wanting strength   thee   good, 
    pluck'd   swallowing womb 
   deep pit, poor bassianus' grave. 
    strength  pluck thee   brink. 
 martius     strength  climb  thy help.
