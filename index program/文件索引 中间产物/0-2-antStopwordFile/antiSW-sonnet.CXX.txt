sonnet cxxsonnet cxxthat    unkind befriends  now,
   sorrow     feel
     transgression bow,
  nerves  brass  hammer'd steel.
      unkindness shaken
   yours,  pass'd a hell  time,
 i, a tyrant,   leisure 
 weigh    suffered   crime.
o,   night  woe   remember'd
 deepest sense,  hard true sorrow hits,
   you,    me,  tender'd
 humble slave  wounded bosoms fits!
   trespass   a fee;
 ransoms yours,    ransom me.
