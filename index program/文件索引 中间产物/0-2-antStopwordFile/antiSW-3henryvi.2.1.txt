    slain,    heard  news; 
    'scaped, methinks    heard 
  happy tidings   good escape. 
  fares  brother?     sad? 
 richard    joy,    resolved 
    valiant father  become. 
      battle range about; 
  watch'd    singled clifford forth. 
 methought  bore    thickest troop 
  doth a lion  a herd  neat; 
   a bear, encompass'd   dogs, 
   pinch'd a     cry, 
  rest stand  aloof,  bark  him. 
  fared  father   enemies; 
  fled  enemies  warlike father: 
 methinks, 'tis prize     son. 
    morning opes  golden gates, 
  takes  farewell   glorious sun! 
   resembles   prime  youth, 
 trimm'd  a younker prancing   love! 
 edward  dazzle  eyes,      suns? 
 richard   glorious suns,   a perfect sun; 
  separated   racking clouds, 
  sever'd  a pale clear-shining sky. 
 see, see!  join, embrace,    kiss, 
    vow'd  league inviolable: 
      lamp,  light,  sun.

 richard     died,    hear  all. 
 messenger  environed     foes, 
  stood  them,   hope  troy 
   greeks    enter'd troy. 
  hercules   yield  odds; 
   strokes,   a  axe, 
 hew   fell  hardest-timber'd oak. 
   hands  father  subdued; 
   slaughter'd   ireful arm 
  unrelenting clifford   queen, 
  crown'd  gracious duke  high despite, 
 laugh'd   face;    grief  wept, 
  ruthless queen gave   dry  cheeks 
 a napkin steeped   harmless blood 
  sweet young rutland,  rough clifford slain: 
    scorns,  foul taunts, 
    head,    gates  york 
  set  same;    doth remain,

 ah,   break  hence,    body 
    ground  closed   rest! 
   henceforth   joy again, 
 never, o      joy! 
 richard    weep;    body's moisture 
 scarce serves  quench  furnace-burning heart: 
    tongue unload  heart's great burthen; 
  selfsame wind    speak withal 
  kindling coals  fires   breast, 
  burns    flames  tears  quench. 
  weep      depth  grief: 
 tears   babes; blows  revenge

  die renowned  attempting it.
