    |      i. a lane   wall  capulet's orchard. 
 enter romeo  romeo        heart  here? 
 turn back, dull earth,  find thy centre out. 

  climbs  wall,  leaps    
 enter benvolio  mercutio  benvolio  romeo!  cousin romeo! 
 mercutio    wise; 
 and,   lie, hath stol'n  home  bed. 
 benvolio   ran  way,  leap'd  orchard wall: 
 call, good mercutio. 
 mercutio  nay,  conjure too. 
 romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! 
  thou   likeness  a sigh: 
 speak   rhyme,    satisfied; 
 cry  'ay me!' pronounce  'love'  'dove;' 
 speak   gossip venus  fair word, 
  nick-name   purblind son  heir, 
 young adam cupid,   shot  trim, 
  king cophetua loved  beggar-maid! 
  heareth not,  stirreth not,  moveth not; 
  ape  dead,    conjure him. 
  conjure thee  rosaline's bright eyes, 
   high forehead   scarlet lip, 
   fine foot, straight leg  quivering thigh 
   demesnes   adjacent lie, 
   thy likeness thou   us! 
 benvolio     hear thee, thou wilt anger him. 
 mercutio    anger him: 'twould anger  
  raise a spirit   mistress' circle 
   strange nature, letting   stand 
    laid   conjured  down; 
    spite:  invocation 
  fair  honest,    mistres s'  
  conjure    raise  him. 
 benvolio  come,  hath hid    trees, 
   consorted   humorous night: 
 blind   love   befits  dark. 
 mercutio   love  blind, love  hit  mark. 
    sit  a medlar tree, 
    mistress   kind  fruit 
  maids call medlars,   laugh alone. 
 romeo,   were, o,    
  open  caetera, thou a poperin pear! 
 romeo, good night:    truckle-bed; 
  field-bed   cold    sleep: 
 come,   go? 
 benvolio  go, then;  'tis  vain 
  seek    means    found.
