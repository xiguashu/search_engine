sonnet xlviiisonnet xlviiihow careful  i,     way,
 trifle  truest bars  thrust,
      unused stay
 hands  falsehood,   wards  trust!
 thou,    jewels trifles are,
 worthy  comfort,   greatest grief,
thou,   dearest    care,
art left  prey   vulgar thief.
thee    lock'd    chest,
save  thou art not,   feel thou art,
  gentle closure   breast,
   pleasure thou mayst   part;
   thou wilt  stol'n,  fear,
 truth proves thievish  a prize  dear.
