 a deceived husband;  love's face
   love  me,  alter'd new;
thy   me, thy heart   place:
   live  hatred  thine eye,
      thy change.
 many's   false heart's history
 writ  moods  frowns  wrinkles strange,
 heaven  thy creation  decree
  thy face sweet love   dwell;
whate'er thy thoughts  thy heart's workings be,

  eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
 thy sweet virtue answer  thy show!
