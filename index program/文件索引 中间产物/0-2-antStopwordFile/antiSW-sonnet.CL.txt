sonnet clsonnet clo,   power hast thou  powerful 
 insufficiency  heart  sway?
   give  lie   true sight,
 swear  brightness doth  grace  day?
 hast thou     ill,
    refuse  thy deeds
   strength  warrantize  skill
that,   mind, thy worst   exceeds?
 taught thee     love thee 
   hear      hate?
o,   love    abhor,
  thou shouldst  abhor  state:
 thy unworthiness raised love  me,
 worthy    beloved  thee.
