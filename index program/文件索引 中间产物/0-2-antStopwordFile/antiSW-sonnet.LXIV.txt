sonnet lxivsonnet lxivwhen     time's fell hand defaced
 rich proud cost  outworn buried age;
  lofty towers   down-razed
 brass eternal slave  mortal rage;
     hungry ocean gain
advantage   kingdom   shore,
  firm soil win   watery main,
increasing store  loss  loss  store;
     interchange  state,
 state  confounded  decay;
ruin hath taught    ruminate,
 time      love away.
 thought   a death,   choose
 weep      fears  lose.
