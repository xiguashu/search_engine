sonnet cxiiisonnet cxiiisince  left you,  eye    mind;
   governs    
doth part  function   partly blind,
 seeing,  effectually  out;
   form delivers   heart
 bird  flower,  shape,   doth latch:
  quick objects hath  mind  part,
   vision holds   doth catch:
     rudest  gentlest sight,
  sweet favour  deformed'st creature,
 mountain   sea,  day  night,
 crow  dove,  shapes    feature:
incapable  more, replete  you,
  true mind    eye untrue.
