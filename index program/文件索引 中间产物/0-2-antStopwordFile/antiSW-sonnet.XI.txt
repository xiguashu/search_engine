sonnet xisonnet xias fast  thou shalt wane,  fast thou growest
   thine,    thou departest;
  fresh blood  youngly thou bestowest
thou mayst call thine  thou  youth convertest.
 lives wisdom, beauty  increase:
 this, folly, age  cold decay:
   minded so,  times  cease
 threescore year    world away.
   nature hath    store,
harsh featureless  rude, barrenly perish:
look,    endow'd  gave  more;
 bounteous gift thou shouldst  bounty cherish:
 carved thee   seal,  meant 
thou shouldst print more,    copy die.
