sonnet lxxiiisonnet lxxiiithat time  year thou mayst   behold
 yellow leaves,  none,  few,  hang
  boughs  shake   cold,
bare ruin'd choirs,  late  sweet birds sang.
  thou seest  twilight   day
  sunset fadeth   west,
    black night doth  away,
death's  self,  seals    rest.
  thou see'st  glowing   fire
   ashes   youth doth lie,
  death-bed whereon   expire
consumed      nourish'd by.
 thou perceivest,   thy love  strong,
 love    thou  leave ere long.
