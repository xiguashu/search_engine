sonnet xcsonnet xcthen hate   thou wilt;  ever, now;
now,   world  bent  deeds  cross,
join   spite  fortune,   bow,
   drop    after-loss:
ah,  not,   heart hath 'scoped  sorrow,
   rearward  a conquer'd woe;
give  a windy night a rainy morrow,
 linger  a purposed overthrow.
 thou wilt leave me,   leave  last,
  petty griefs    spite
   onset come;    taste
    worst  fortune's might,
  strains  woe,    woe,
compared  loss  thee    so.
