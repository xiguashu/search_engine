    |      iii. friar laurence's cell. 
 enter friar laurence  friar laurence  romeo,  forth;  forth, thou fearful man: 
 affliction  enamour'd  thy parts, 
  thou art wedded  calamity. 

 enter romeo  romeo  father,  news?    prince's doom? 
  sorrow craves acquaintance   hand, 
     not? 
 friar laurence   familiar 
   dear son   sour company: 
  bring thee tidings   prince's doom. 
 romeo     dooms-day   prince's doom? 
 friar laurence  a gentler judgment vanish'd   lips, 
  body's death,  body's banishment. 
 romeo  ha, banishment!  merciful,  'death;' 
  exile hath  terror   look, 
    death:    'banishment.' 
 friar laurence    verona art thou banished: 
  patient,   world  broad  wide. 
 romeo     world  verona walls, 
  purgatory, torture, hell itself. 
 hence-banished  banish'd   world, 
  world's exile  death:  banished, 
  death mis-term'd: calling death banishment, 
 thou cutt'st  head   a golden axe, 
  smilest   stroke  murders me. 
 friar laurence  o deadly sin! o rude unthankfulness! 
 thy fault  law calls death;   kind prince, 
  thy part, hath rush'd   law, 
  turn'd  black word death  banishment: 
   dear mercy,  thou seest  not. 
 romeo  'tis torture,   mercy: heaven  here, 
  juliet lives;   cat  dog 
   mouse,  unworthy thing, 
 live   heaven     her; 
  romeo  not:  validity, 
  honourable state,  courtship lives 
  carrion-flies  romeo:   seize 
   white   dear juliet's hand 
  steal immortal blessing   lips, 
    pure  vestal modesty, 
  blush,  thinking   kisses sin; 
  romeo  not;   banished: 
 flies   this,      fly: 
   free men,    banished. 
  say'st thou   exile   death? 
 hadst thou  poison mix'd,  sharp-ground knife, 
  sudden   death,  ne'er  mean, 
  'banished'  kill me?--'banished'? 
 o friar,  damned   word  hell; 
 howlings attend it:  hast thou  heart, 
  a divine, a ghostly confessor, 
 a sin-absolver,   friend profess'd, 
  mangle    word 'banished'? 
 friar laurence  thou fond mad man, hear   speak a word. 
 romeo  o, thou wilt speak   banishment. 
 friar laurence   give thee armour     word: 
 adversity's sweet milk, philosophy, 
  comfort thee,  thou art banished. 
 romeo   'banished'? hang  philosophy! 
  philosophy   a juliet, 
 displant a town, reverse a prince's doom, 
  helps not,  prevails not: talk  more. 
 friar laurence  o,     madmen   ears. 
 romeo    they,   wise men   eyes? 
 friar laurence    dispute  thee  thy estate. 
 romeo  thou canst  speak   thou dost  feel: 
 wert thou  young  i, juliet thy love, 
  hour  married, tybalt murdered, 
 doting      banished, 
  mightst thou speak,  mightst thou tear thy hair, 
  fall   ground,    now, 
   measure   unmade grave. 

 knocking   friar laurence  arise;  knocks; good romeo, hide thyself. 
 romeo   i;   breath  heartsick groans, 
 mist-like, infold    search  eyes. 

 knocking  friar laurence  hark,   knock!  there? romeo, arise; 
 thou wilt  taken. stay awhile! stand up; 

 knocking  run   study.   by! god's will, 
  simpleness  this!  come,  come! 

 knocking   knocks  hard?   you?   will? 
 nurse  [within]     in,     
  errand; 
    lady juliet. 
 friar laurence  welcome, then. 

 enter nurse  nurse  o holy friar, o,  me, holy friar, 
    lady's lord,  romeo? 
 friar laurence     ground,    tears  drunk. 
 nurse  o,      mistress' case, 
    case! o woful sympathy! 
 piteous predicament!   lies she, 
 blubbering  weeping, weeping  blubbering. 
 stand up, stand up; stand,    a man: 
  juliet's sake,   sake, rise  stand; 
    fall   deep  o? 
 romeo  nurse! 
 nurse  ah sir! ah sir! well, death's    all. 
 romeo  spakest thou  juliet?     her? 
 doth       murderer, 
    stain'd  childhood   joy 
  blood removed     own? 
   she?   doth she?    
  conceal'd lady   cancell'd love? 
 nurse  o,   nothing, sir,  weeps  weeps; 
   falls   bed;   starts up, 
  tybalt calls;    romeo cries, 
    falls again. 
 romeo     name, 
 shot   deadly level  a gun, 
  murder her;   name's cursed hand 
 murder'd  kinsman. o,  me, friar,  me, 
   vile part   anatomy 
 doth   lodge?  me,    sack 
  hateful mansion. 

 drawing  sword  friar laurence  hold thy desperate hand: 
 art thou a man? thy form cries  thou art: 
 thy tears  womanish; thy wild acts denote 
  unreasonable fury  a beast: 
 unseemly woman  a  man! 
  ill-beseeming beast   both! 
 thou hast amazed me:   holy order, 
  thought thy disposition  temper'd. 
 hast thou slain tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself? 
  stay thy lady   lives  thee, 
   damned hate  thyself? 
  rail'st thou  thy birth,  heaven,  earth? 
  birth,  heaven,  earth,    meet 
  thee  once;  thou   wouldst lose. 
 fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit; 
 which,  a usurer, abound'st  all, 
  usest    true   
   bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit: 
 thy noble shape   a form  wax, 
 digressing   valour  a man; 
 thy dear love sworn  hollow perjury, 
 killing  love  thou hast vow'd  cherish; 
 thy wit,  ornament  shape  love, 
 misshapen   conduct   both, 
  powder  a skitless soldier's flask, 
  set afire  thine  ignorance, 
  thou dismember'd  thine  defence. 
 what, rouse thee, man! thy juliet  alive, 
   dear sake thou wast   dead; 
  art thou happy: tybalt  kill thee, 
  thou slew'st tybalt;   thou happy too: 
  law  threaten'd death  thy friend 
  turns   exile;  art thou happy: 
 a pack  blessings lights   thy back; 
 happiness courts thee    array; 
 but,  a misbehaved  sullen wench, 
 thou pout'st  thy fortune  thy love: 
  heed,  heed,   die miserable. 
 go,  thee  thy love,   decreed, 
 ascend  chamber,   comfort her: 
   thou stay    watch  set, 
   thou canst  pass  mantua; 
  thou shalt live,    find a time 
  blaze  marriage, reconcile  friends, 
 beg pardon   prince,  call thee  
  twenty  thousand times  joy 
  thou went'st   lamentation. 
  before, nurse: commend   thy lady; 
  bid  hasten   house  bed, 
  heavy sorrow   apt unto: 
 romeo  coming. 
 nurse  o lord,    stay'd    night 
  hear good counsel: o,  learning is! 
  lord,    lady   come. 
 romeo   so,  bid  sweet prepare  chide. 
 nurse  here, sir, a ring  bid  give you, sir: 
 hie you,  haste,   grows  late. 

 exit  romeo     comfort  revived  this! 
 friar laurence   hence; good night;   stands   state: 
      watch  set, 
    break  day disguised  hence: 
 sojourn  mantua;  find   man, 
    signify  time  time 
  good hap    chances here: 
 give  thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night. 
 romeo    a joy  joy calls   me, 
   a grief,    part  thee: farewell.
