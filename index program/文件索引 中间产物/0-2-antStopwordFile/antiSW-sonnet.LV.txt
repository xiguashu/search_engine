sonnet lvsonnet lvnot marble,   gilded monuments
 princes,  outlive  powerful rhyme;
   shine  bright   contents
 unswept stone besmear'd  sluttish time.
 wasteful war  statues overturn,
 broils root   work  masonry,
 mars  sword  war's quick fire  burn
 living record   memory.
'gainst death  all-oblivious enmity
  pace forth;  praise   find room
   eyes   posterity
 wear  world     doom.
so,   judgment   arise,
 live  this,  dwell  lover's eyes.
