sonnet lxvsonnet lxvsince brass,  stone,  earth,  boundless sea,
 sad mortality o'er-sways  power,
   rage  beauty hold a plea,
 action   stronger  a flower?
o,   summer's honey breath hold 
  wreckful siege  battering days,
 rocks impregnable    stout,
 gates  steel  strong,  time decays?
o fearful meditation! where, alack,
 time's  jewel  time's chest lie hid?
  strong hand  hold  swift foot back?
   spoil  beauty  forbid?
o, none,   miracle  might,
  black ink  love   shine bright.
