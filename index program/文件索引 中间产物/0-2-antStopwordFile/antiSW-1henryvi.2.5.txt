    |      v.  tower  london. 
 enter mortimer, brought  a chair,  gaolers  mortimer  kind keepers   weak decaying age, 
  dying mortimer  rest himself. 
   a   haled   rack, 
  fare  limbs  long imprisonment. 
   grey locks,  pursuivants  death, 
 nestor-like aged   age  care, 
 argue    edmund mortimer. 
  eyes,  lamps  wasting oil  spent, 
 wax dim,  drawing   exigent; 
 weak shoulders, overborne  burthening grief, 
  pithless arms,   a wither'd vine 
  droops  sapless branches   ground; 
    feet,  strengthless stay  numb, 
 unable  support  lump  clay, 
 swift-winged  desire   a grave, 
  witting    comfort have. 
   me, keeper,   nephew come? 
  gaoler  richard plantagenet,  lord,  come: 
     temple,   chamber; 
  answer  return'd    come. 
 mortimer  enough:  soul    satisfied. 
 poor gentleman!  wrong doth equal mine. 
  henry monmouth  began  reign, 
   glory   great  arms, 
  loathsome sequestration   had: 
     hath richard  obscured, 
 deprived  honour  inheritance. 
    arbitrator  despairs, 
  death, kind umpire  men's miseries, 
  sweet enlargement doth dismiss  hence: 
    troubles   expired, 
     recover   lost. 

 enter richard plantagenet   gaoler   lord,  loving nephew   come. 
 mortimer  richard plantagenet,  friend,   come? 
 richard 
 plantagenet  ay, noble uncle,  ignobly used, 
  nephew, late despised richard, comes. 
 mortimer  direct  arms   embrace  neck, 
    bosom spend   gasp: 
 o,     lips  touch  cheeks, 
    kindly give  fainting kiss. 
   declare, sweet stem  york's great stock, 
  didst thou say,  late thou wert despised? 
 richard 
 plantagenet  first, lean thine aged    arm; 
 and,   ease,   thee  disease. 
  day,  argument  a case, 
  words  grew 'twixt somerset  me; 
   terms    lavish tongue 
   upbraid    father's death: 
  obloquy set bars   tongue, 
       requited him. 
 therefore, good uncle,   father's sake, 
  honour  a true plantagenet 
   alliance sake, declare   
  father, earl  cambridge, lost  head. 
 mortimer   cause, fair nephew,  imprison'd  
  hath detain'd    flowering youth 
  a loathsome dungeon,   pine, 
  cursed instrument   decease. 
 richard 
 plantagenet  discover   large    was, 
    ignorant   guess. 
 mortimer   will,    fading breath permit 
  death approach  ere  tale  done. 
 henry  fourth, grandfather   king, 
 deposed  nephew richard, edward's son, 
  first-begotten   lawful heir, 
  edward king,     descent: 
   reign  percies   north, 
 finding  usurpation  unjust, 
 endeavor'd  advancement   throne: 
  reason moved  warlike lords   
 was,  that--young king richard  removed, 
 leaving  heir begotten   body-- 
      birth  parentage; 
    mother  derived  
  lionel duke  clarence,   son 
  king edward  third;   
  john  gaunt doth bring  pedigree, 
   fourth   heroic line. 
  mark:    haughty attempt 
  laboured  plant  rightful heir, 
  lost  liberty    lives. 
 long  this,  henry  fifth, 
 succeeding  father bolingbroke,  reign, 
 thy father, earl  cambridge,  derived 
  famous edmund langley, duke  york, 
 marrying  sister  thy mother was, 
   pity   hard distress 
 levied  army, weening  redeem 
   install'd    diadem: 
 but,   rest,  fell  noble earl 
   beheaded.   mortimers, 
    tide rested,  suppress'd. 
 richard 
 plantagenet   which,  lord,  honour   last. 
 mortimer  true;  thou seest    issue  
    fainting words  warrant death; 
 thou art  heir;  rest   thee gather: 
    wary  thy studious care. 
 richard 
 plantagenet  thy grave admonishments prevail  me: 
  yet, methinks,  father's execution 
     bloody tyranny. 
 mortimer   silence, nephew,  thou politic: 
 strong-fixed   house  lancaster, 
   a mountain,    removed. 
   thy uncle  removing hence: 
  princes   courts,    cloy'd 
  long continuance  a settled place. 
 richard 
 plantagenet  o, uncle,   part   young years 
   redeem  passage   age! 
 mortimer  thou dost  wrong me,   slaughterer doth 
  giveth  wounds    kill. 
 mourn not,  thou sorrow   good; 
  give order   funeral: 
   farewell,  fair   thy hopes 
  prosperous  thy life  peace  war! 

 dies  richard 
 plantagenet   peace,  war, befall thy parting soul! 
  prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage 
   a hermit overpass'd thy days. 
 well,   lock  counsel   breast; 
     imagine   rest. 
 keepers, convey  hence,    
    burial    life. 

 exeunt gaolers, bearing   body  mortimer   dies  dusky torch  mortimer, 
 choked  ambition   meaner sort: 
    wrongs,  bitter injuries, 
  somerset hath offer'd   house: 
  doubt    honour  redress; 
   haste    parliament, 
    restored   blood, 
    ill  advantage   good.
