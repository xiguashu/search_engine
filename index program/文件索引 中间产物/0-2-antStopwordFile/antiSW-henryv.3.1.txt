 alarum. enter king henry, exeter, bedford, gloucester,  soldiers,  scaling-ladders  king henry       breach, dear friends,  more; 
  close  wall    english dead. 
  peace     a  
  modest stillness  humility: 
    blast  war blows   ears, 
  imitate  action   tiger; 
 stiffen  sinews, summon   blood, 
 disguise fair nature  hard-favour'd rage; 
  lend  eye a terrible aspect; 
  pry   portage   head 
   brass cannon;   brow o'erwhelm  
  fearfully  doth a galled rock 
 o'erhang  jutty  confounded base, 
 swill'd   wild  wasteful ocean. 
  set  teeth  stretch  nostril wide, 
 hold hard  breath  bend   spirit 
   full height. on, on,  noblest english. 
  blood  fet  fathers  war-proof! 
 fathers that,    alexanders, 
    parts  morn   fought 
  sheathed  swords  lack  argument: 
 dishonour   mothers;  attest 
     call'd fathers  beget you. 
  copy   men  grosser blood, 
  teach    war.  you, good yeoman, 
  limbs    england, show   
  mettle   pasture;   swear 
    worth  breeding;   doubt not; 
          base, 
  hath  noble lustre   eyes. 
    stand  greyhounds   slips, 
 straining   start.  game's afoot: 
 follow  spirit,    charge 
 cry 'god  harry, england,  saint george!'
