sonnet clivsonnet clivthe  love-god lying  asleep
laid   side  heart-inflaming brand,
  nymphs  vow'd chaste life  
 tripping by;    maiden hand
 fairest votary    fire
  legions  true hearts  warm'd;
   general  hot desire
 sleeping  a virgin hand disarm'd.
 brand  quenched  a cool  by,
  love's fire  heat perpetual,
growing a bath  healthful remedy
 men diseased;  i,  mistress' thrall,
   cure,      prove,
love's fire heats water, water cools  love.
