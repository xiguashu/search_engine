    |      i. messina. pompey's house. 
 enter pompey, menecrates,  menas,  warlike manner  pompey    great gods  just,   assist 
  deeds  justest men. 
 menecrates  know, worthy pompey, 
     delay,   deny. 
 pompey  whiles   suitors   throne, decays 
    sue for. 
 menecrates  we, ignorant  ourselves, 
 beg    harms,   wise powers 
 deny    good;  find  profit 
  losing   prayers. 
 pompey     well: 
  people love me,   sea  mine; 
  powers  crescent,   auguring hope 
       full. mark antony 
  egypt sits  dinner,    
  wars  doors: caesar  money  
  loses hearts: lepidus flatters both, 
    flatter'd;    loves, 
   cares  him. 
 menas  caesar  lepidus 
    field: a mighty strength  carry. 
 pompey     this? 'tis false. 
 menas   silvius, sir. 
 pompey   dreams:      rome together, 
   antony.    charms  love, 
 salt cleopatra, soften thy waned lip! 
  witchcraft join  beauty, lust  both! 
 tie   libertine  a field  feasts, 
   brain fuming; epicurean cooks 
 sharpen  cloyless sauce  appetite; 
  sleep  feeding  prorogue  honour 
   a lethe'd dulness! 

 enter varrius   now, varrius! 
 varrius         deliver: 
 mark antony   hour  rome 
 expected:     egypt 'tis 
 a space   travel. 
 pompey       matter 
 a  ear. menas,     
  amorous surfeiter   donn'd  helm 
   a petty war:  soldiership 
     twain:    rear 
  higher  opinion,   stirring 
    lap  egypt's widow pluck 
  ne'er-lust-wearied antony. 
 menas    hope 
 caesar  antony   greet together: 
  wife  dead  trespasses  caesar; 
  brother warr'd  him; although,  think, 
  moved  antony. 
 pompey    not, menas, 
  lesser enmities  give   greater. 
 were't    stand    all, 
 'twere pregnant   square  
 themselves; 
    entertained   
  draw  swords:    fear   
  cement  divisions  bind  
  petty difference,    know. 
 be't   gods  have't!   stands 
  lives     strongest hands. 
 come, menas.
