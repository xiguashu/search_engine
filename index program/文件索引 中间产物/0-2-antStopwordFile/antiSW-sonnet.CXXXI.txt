sonnet cxxxisonnet cxxxithou art  tyrannous,   thou art,
   beauties proudly   cruel;
  thou know'st   dear doting heart
thou art  fairest   precious jewel.
yet,  good faith,    thee behold
thy face hath   power   love groan:
   err      bold,
  swear    alone.
and,       false  swear,
a thousand groans,  thinking  thy face,
  another's neck,  witness bear
thy black  fairest   judgment's place.
  art thou black save  thy deeds,
   slander,   think, proceeds.
