sonnet cixsonnet cixo,      false  heart,
 absence seem'd  flame  qualify.
 easy     depart
   soul,   thy breast doth lie:
   home  love:    ranged,
   travels  return again,
   time,    time exchanged,
   bring water   stain.
 believe,    nature reign'd
 frailties  besiege  kinds  blood,
    preposterously  stain'd,
 leave    thy sum  good;
   wide universe  call,
save thou,  rose;   thou art  all.
