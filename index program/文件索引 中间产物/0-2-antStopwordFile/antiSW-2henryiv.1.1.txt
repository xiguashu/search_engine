 enter morton  northumberland  yea,  man's brow,   a title-leaf, 
 foretells  nature  a tragic volume: 
    strand whereon  imperious flood 
 hath left a witness'd usurpation. 
 say, morton, didst thou   shrewsbury? 
 morton   ran  shrewsbury,  noble lord; 
  hateful death put   ugliest mask 
  fright  party. 
 northumberland   doth  son  brother? 
 thou tremblest;   whiteness  thy cheek 
  apter  thy tongue   thy errand. 
   a man,  faint,  spiritless, 
  dull,  dead  look,  woe-begone, 
 drew priam's curtain   dead  night, 
    told    troy  burnt; 
  priam   fire ere   tongue, 
    percy's death ere thou report'st it. 
  thou wouldst say, ' son    thus; 
  brother thus:  fought  noble douglas:' 
 stopping  greedy ear   bold deeds: 
    end,  stop  ear indeed, 
 thou hast a sigh  blow   praise, 
   'brother, son,    dead.' 
 morton  douglas  living,   brother, yet; 
 but,   lord  son-- 
 northumberland  why,   dead. 
   a ready tongue suspicion hath! 
    fears

    fear'd  chanced.  speak, morton; 
  thou  earl  divination lies, 
       a sweet disgrace

 morton     great     gainsaid: 
  spirit   true,  fears  certain. 
 northumberland  yet,   this,    percy's dead. 
   a strange confession  thine eye: 
 thou shakest thy head  hold'st  fear  sin 
  speak a truth.    slain,  so; 
  tongue offends   reports  death: 
   doth sin  doth belie  dead, 
      dead   alive. 
    bringer  unwelcome news 
 hath  a losing office,   tongue 
 sounds    a sullen bell, 
 remember'd tolling a departing friend. 
 lord bardolph    think,  lord,  son  dead. 
 morton       force    
      god    seen; 
    eyes    bloody state, 
 rendering faint quittance, wearied  out-breathed, 
  harry monmouth;  swift wrath beat  
  never-daunted percy   earth, 
    life    sprung up.

  strengthless hinges, buckle  life, 
 impatient   fit, breaks  a fire 
    keeper's arms,    limbs, 
 weaken'd  grief,   enraged  grief, 
  thrice themselves. hence, therefore, thou nice crutch! 
 a scaly gauntlet   joints  steel

    world  longer  a stage 
  feed contention  a lingering act; 
    spirit   first-born cain 
 reign   bosoms, that,  heart  set 
  bloody courses,  rude   end, 
  darkness   burier   dead! 
 travers   strained passion doth  wrong,  lord. 
 lord bardolph  sweet earl, divorce  wisdom   honour. 
 morton   lives    loving complices 
 lean   health;  which,   give o'er 
  stormy passion,  perforce decay. 
  cast  event  war,  noble lord, 
  summ'd  account  chance,    
 '   head.'    presurmise, 
 that,   dole  blows,  son  drop: 
  knew  walk'd o'er perils,   edge,

     ' forth;'    this, 
  strongly apprehended,  restrain 
  stiff-borne action:  hath  befallen, 
   hath  bold enterprise brought forth, 
         be? 
 lord bardolph      engaged   loss 
 knew   ventured   dangerous seas 
    wrought  life 'twas ten  one; 
    ventured,   gain proposed 
 choked  respect   peril fear'd; 
     o'erset, venture again. 
 come,    put forth, body  goods. 
 morton  'tis   time: and,   noble lord, 
  hear  certain,   speak  truth, 
  gentle archbishop  york   
  well-appointed powers:   a  
   a double surety binds  followers. 
  lord  son     corpse, 
  shadows   shows  men,  fight; 
    word, rebellion,  divide 
  action   bodies   souls; 
    fight  queasiness, constrain'd, 
  men drink potions,   weapons  
 seem'd   side; but,   spirits  souls, 
  word, rebellion,   froze  up, 
  fish   a pond.    bishop 
 turns insurrection  religion: 
 supposed sincere  holy   thoughts, 
     body   mind; 
  doth enlarge  rising   blood 
  fair king richard, scraped  pomfret stones; 
 derives  heaven  quarrel   cause; 
 tells   doth bestride a bleeding land, 
 gasping  life  great bolingbroke; 
      flock  follow him. 
 northumberland   knew   before; but,  speak truth, 
  present grief  wiped    mind. 
    me;  counsel   
  aptest   safety  revenge: 
  posts  letters,   friends  speed: 
   few,     need.
