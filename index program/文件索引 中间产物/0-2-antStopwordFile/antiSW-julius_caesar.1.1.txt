     i. rome. a street. 
 enter flavius, marullus,   commoners  flavius  hence! home,  idle creatures   home: 
   a holiday? what!   not, 
  mechanical,    walk 
  a labouring day   sign 
   profession? speak,  trade art thou? 
  commoner  why, sir, a carpenter. 
 marullus    thy leather apron  thy rule? 
  dost thou  thy  apparel on? 
 you, sir,  trade  you? 
  commoner  truly, sir,  respect  a fine workman,   but, 
    say, a cobbler. 
 marullus    trade art thou? answer  directly. 
  commoner  a trade, sir, that,  hope,     a safe 
 conscience;  is, indeed, sir, a mender  bad soles. 
 marullus   trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave,  trade? 
  commoner  nay,  beseech you, sir,     me: yet, 
    out, sir,   mend you. 
 marullus   meanest thou  that? mend me, thou saucy fellow! 
  commoner  why, sir, cobble you. 
 flavius  thou art a cobbler, art thou? 
  commoner  truly, sir,    live     awl:  
 meddle   tradesman's matters,  women's 
 matters,   awl.  am, indeed, sir, a surgeon 
   shoes;     great danger,  
 recover them.  proper men   trod  
 neat's leather     handiwork. 
 flavius   wherefore art   thy shop today? 
  dost thou lead  men   streets? 
  commoner  truly, sir,  wear   shoes,    
   work. but, indeed, sir,   holiday, 
   caesar   rejoice   triumph. 
 marullus  wherefore rejoice?  conquest brings  home? 
  tributaries follow   rome, 
  grace  captive bonds  chariot-wheels? 
  blocks,  stones,  worse  senseless things! 
 o  hard hearts,  cruel men  rome, 
 knew   pompey?  a time  oft 
   climb'd   walls  battlements, 
  towers  windows, yea,  chimney-tops, 
  infants   arms,    sat 
  livelong day,  patient expectation, 
   great pompey pass  streets  rome: 
      chariot  appear, 
      universal shout, 
  tiber trembled   banks, 
  hear  replication   sounds 
    concave shores? 
     put    attire? 
     cull  a holiday? 
     strew flowers    
    triumph  pompey's blood?  gone! 
 run   houses, fall   knees, 
 pray   gods  intermit  plague 
    light   ingratitude. 
 flavius  go, go, good countrymen, and,   fault, 
 assemble   poor men   sort; 
 draw   tiber banks,  weep  tears 
   channel,   lowest stream 
  kiss   exalted shores  all. 

 exeunt   commoners     basest metal   moved; 
  vanish tongue-tied   guiltiness. 
        capitol; 
      disrobe  images, 
    find  deck'd  ceremonies. 
 marullus     so? 
      feast  lupercal. 
 flavius     matter;   images 
  hung  caesar's trophies.  about, 
  drive   vulgar   streets: 
    too,   perceive  thick. 
  growing feathers pluck'd  caesar's wing 
    fly  ordinary pitch, 
    soar   view  men 
      servile fearfulness.
