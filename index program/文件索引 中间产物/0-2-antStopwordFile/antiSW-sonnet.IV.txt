sonnet ivsonnet ivunthrifty loveliness,  dost thou spend
 thyself thy beauty's legacy?
nature's bequest    doth lend,
  frank  lends    free.
then, beauteous niggard,  dost thou abuse
 bounteous largess  thee  give?
profitless usurer,  dost thou 
 great a sum  sums,  canst  live?
  traffic  thyself alone,
thou  thyself thy sweet  dost deceive.
 how,  nature calls thee   gone,
 acceptable audit canst thou leave?
thy unused beauty   tomb'd  thee,
which, used, lives th' executor  be.
