sonnet lxvisonnet lxvitired   these,  restful death  cry,
as,  behold desert a beggar born,
 needy  trimm'd  jollity,
 purest faith unhappily forsworn,
 guilded honour shamefully misplaced,
 maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
  perfection wrongfully disgraced,
 strength  limping sway disabled,
 art  tongue-tied  authority,
 folly doctor-like controlling skill,
 simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
 captive good attending captain ill:
tired   these,      gone,
save that,  die,  leave  love alone.
