  youth  well.  hear  english king;

   victorious hand  feebled here, 
    chambers gave  chastisement? 
 no:   gallant monarch   arms 
    eagle o'er  aery towers, 
  souse annoyance     nest. 
   degenerate,  ingrate revolts, 
  bloody neroes, ripping   womb 
   dear mother england, blush  shame; 
    ladies  pale-visaged maids 
  amazons  tripping  drums, 
  thimbles  armed gauntlets change, 
  needles  lances,   gentle hearts 
  fierce  bloody inclination.

 bastard    drums,  beaten,  cry out; 
    you,  beaten:   start 
  echo   clamour  thy drum, 
    hand a drum  ready braced 
   reverberate   loud  thine; 
 sound  another,    
  loud  thine rattle  welkin's ear 
  mock  deep-mouth'd thunder:   hand, 
  trusting   halting legate here, 
   hath    sport   
  warlike john;    forehead sits 
 a bare-ribb'd death,  office   day 
  feast   thousands   french. 
 lewis  strike   drums,  find  danger out. 
 bastard   thou shalt find it, dauphin,   doubt.
