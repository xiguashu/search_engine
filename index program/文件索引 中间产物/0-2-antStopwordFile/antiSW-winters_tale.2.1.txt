 'tis  enduring. 
  lady  come,  gracious lord, 
     playfellow? 
 mamillius  no,    you. 
  lady  why,  sweet lord? 
 mamillius   kiss  hard  speak     
   a baby still.  love  better. 
  lady    so,  lord? 
 mamillius     
  brows  blacker;  black brows,  say, 
   women best,      
   hair there,   a semicircle 
  a half-moon   a pen. 
  lady   taught  this? 
 mamillius   learnt    women's faces. pray  
  colour   eyebrows? 
  lady  blue,  lord. 
 mamillius  nay,  a mock:    a lady's nose 
    blue,    eyebrows. 
  lady  hark ye; 
  queen  mother rounds apace:   
 present  services  a fine  prince 
    days;   you'ld wanton  us, 
     you. 
  lady    spread  late 
  a goodly bulk: good time encounter her! 
 hermione   wisdom stirs  you? come, sir,  
     again: pray you, sit  us, 
   's a tale. 
 mamillius  merry  sad shall't be? 
 hermione   merry   will. 
 mamillius  a sad tale's   winter:    
  sprites  goblins.

  fright    sprites;  powerful  it. 
 mamillius    a man-- 
 hermione  nay, come, sit down;  on. 
 mamillius  dwelt  a churchyard:     softly; 
 yond crickets   hear it. 
 hermione   on, then, 
  give't    ear. 

 enter leontes,  antigonus, lords    leontes    met there?  train? camillo  him? 
  lord    tuft  pines  met them;  
   men scour    way:  eyed  
    ships. 
 leontes   blest   
    censure,   true opinion! 
 alack,  lesser knowledge!  accursed 
    blest!      cup 
 a spider steep'd,    drink, depart, 
   partake  venom,   knowledge 
   infected:    present 
  abhorr'd ingredient   eye,   
   hath drunk,  cracks  gorge,  sides, 
  violent hefts.   drunk, 
    spider. 
 camillo     this,  pander: 
   a plot   life,  crown; 
 all's true   mistrusted:  false villain 
   employ'd  pre-employ'd  him: 
   discover'd  design,   
 remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a  trick 
    play  will.    posterns 
  easily open? 
  lord    great authority; 
   hath   prevail'd   
   command. 
 leontes   know't  well. 
 give   boy:   glad    nurse him: 
    bear  signs  me,   
    blood  him. 
 hermione    this? sport? 
 leontes  bear  boy hence;      her; 
   him!    sport  
    big with;  'tis polixenes 
   thee swell thus. 
 hermione   i'ld    not, 
    sworn     saying, 
 howe'er  lean   nayward. 
 leontes  you,  lords, 
   her, mark  well;    
   '  a goodly lady,'  
  justice   bearts  thereto add 
 'tis pity   honest, honourable:' 
 praise      without-door form, 
    faith deserves high speech,  straight 
  shrug,  hum  ha,  petty brands 
  calumny doth use--o,   out-- 
  mercy does,  calumny  sear 
 virtue itself:  shrugs,  hums  ha's, 
     ' goodly,'   
 ere    ' honest:'   't known, 
        grieve   be, 
   adulteress. 
 hermione   a villain  so, 
   replenish'd villain   world, 
      villain: you,  lord, 
   mistake. 
 leontes    mistook,  lady, 
 polixenes  leontes: o thou thing! 
    call a creature  thy place, 
  barbarism, making   precedent, 
  a  language    degrees 
  mannerly distinguishment leave  
 betwixt  prince  beggar:    
   adulteress;     whom: 
 more,  a traitor  camillo  
 a federary  her,     
    shame    
     vile principal,   
 a bed-swerver,   bad   
  vulgars give bold'st titles, ay,  privy 
    late escape. 
 hermione  no,   life. 
 privy    this.    grieve you, 
      clearer knowledge,  
    publish'd me! gentle  lord, 
  scarce    throughly    
   mistake. 
 leontes  no;   mistake 
   foundations   build upon, 
  centre   big   bear 
 a school-boy's top.   her!  prison! 
    speak    afar  guilty 
    speaks. 
 hermione    ill planet reigns: 
    patient   heavens  
   aspect  favourable. good  lords, 
    prone  weeping,   sex 
 commonly are;     vain dew 
 perchance  dry  pities:    
  honourable grief lodged   burns 
 worse  tears drown: beseech  all,  lords, 
  thoughts  qualified   charities 
   instruct you, measure me;   
  king's   perform'd! 
 leontes     heard? 
 hermione   is't    me? beseech  highness, 
  women    me;    
  plight requires it.   weep, good fools; 
    cause:      mistress 
  deserved prison,  abound  tears 
    out:  action     
     grace. adieu,  lord: 
   wish'd    sorry;  
  trust  shall.  women, come;   leave. 
 leontes  go,   bidding; hence! 

 exit hermione, guarded;  ladies   lord  beseech  highness, call  queen again. 
 antigonus      do, sir,   justice 
 prove violence;     great  suffer, 
 yourself,  queen,  son. 
  lord   her,  lord, 
    life lay    do't, sir, 
    accept it,   queen  spotless 
 i'  eyes  heaven   you;  mean, 
     accuse her. 
 antigonus    prove 
  otherwise,    stables  
  lodge  wife;    couples  her; 
    feel      trust her; 
   inch  woman   world, 
 ay,  dram  woman's flesh  false,   be. 
 leontes  hold  peaces. 
  lord  good  lord,-- 
 antigonus       speak,   ourselves: 
   abused    putter-on 
    damn'd for't;   knew  villain, 
   land-damn him.   honour-flaw'd, 
    daughters;  eldest  eleven 
     third, nine,   five; 
   prove true,  pay for't: 
   honour, 
  geld 'em all; fourteen    see, 
  bring false generations:   co-heirs; 
     glib    
   produce fair issue. 
 leontes  cease;  more. 
  smell  business  a sense  cold 
   a dead man's nose:    see't  feel't 
   feel  thus;   withal 
  instruments  feel. 
 antigonus     so, 
    grave  bury honesty: 
   a grain    face  sweeten 
    dungy earth. 
 leontes  what! lack  credit? 
  lord       lack  i,  lord, 
   ground;     content  
    honour true   suspicion, 
  blamed for't   might. 
 leontes  why,    
 commune    this,   follow 
  forceful instigation?  prerogative 
 calls   counsels,   natural goodness 
 imparts this;   you,  stupefied 
     skill,     
 relish a truth  us, inform  
       advice:  matter, 
  loss,  gain,  ordering on't,   
 properly ours. 
 antigonus    wish,  liege, 
      silent judgment  it, 
   overture. 
 leontes     be? 
  thou art  ignorant  age, 
  thou wert born a fool. camillo's flight, 
 added   familiarity, 
    gross   touch'd conjecture, 
  lack'd sight only, nought  approbation 
   seeing,   circumstances 
     deed, doth push   proceeding: 
 yet,  a greater confirmation, 
       importance 'twere 
  piteous   wild,   dispatch'd  post 
  sacred delphos,  apollo's temple, 
 cleomenes  dion,    
  stuff'd sufficiency:    oracle 
   bring all;  spiritual counsel had, 
  stop  spur me.    well? 
  lord   done,  lord. 
 leontes     satisfied     
    know,    oracle 
 give rest   minds  others,    
  ignorant credulity   
     truth.    thought  good 
   free person    confined, 
    treachery    fled  
  left   perform. come, follow us; 
    speak  public;   business 
  raise  all. 
 antigonus  [aside] 
  laughter,    it, 
   good truth  known.
