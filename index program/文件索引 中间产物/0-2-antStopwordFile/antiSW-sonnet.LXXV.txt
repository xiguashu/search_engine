sonnet lxxvsonnet lxxvso     thoughts  food  life,
  sweet-season'd showers    ground;
   peace    hold  strife
 'twixt a miser   wealth  found;
 proud   enjoyer  anon
doubting  filching age  steal  treasure,
 counting      alone,
 better'd   world    pleasure;
  full  feasting   sight
    clean starved  a look;
possessing  pursuing  delight,
save         took.
   pine  surfeit day  day,
 gluttoning  all,   away.
