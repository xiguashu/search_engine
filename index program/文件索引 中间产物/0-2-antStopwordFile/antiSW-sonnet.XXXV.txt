sonnet xxxvsonnet xxxvno   grieved    thou hast done:
roses  thorns,  silver fountains mud;
clouds  eclipses stain  moon  sun,
 loathsome canker lives  sweetest bud.
 men  faults,     this,
authorizing thy trespass  compare,
 corrupting, salving thy amiss,
excusing thy sins   thy sins are;
  thy sensual fault  bring  sense--
thy adverse party  thy advocate--
 'gainst  a lawful plea commence:
 civil war    love  hate
   accessary   
  sweet thief  sourly robs  me.
