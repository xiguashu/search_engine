sonnet xxsonnet xxa woman's face  nature's  hand painted
hast thou,  master-mistress   passion;
a woman's gentle heart,   acquainted
 shifting change,   false women's fashion;
 eye  bright  theirs,  false  rolling,
gilding  object   gazeth;
a   hue,  'hues'   controlling,
 steals men's eyes  women's souls amazeth.
  a woman wert thou  created;
 nature,   wrought thee, fell a-doting,
  addition   thee defeated,
 adding     purpose nothing.
   prick'd thee   women's pleasure,
  thy love  thy love's   treasure.
