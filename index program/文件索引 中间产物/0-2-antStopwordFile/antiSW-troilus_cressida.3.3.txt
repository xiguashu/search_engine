  advantage   time prompts  aloud 
  call  recompense.     mind 
 that,   sight  bear    love, 
   abandon'd troy, left  possession, 
 incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself, 
    possess'd conveniences, 
  doubtful fortunes; sequestering    
  time, acquaintance, custom  condition 
  tame   familiar   nature, 
  here,    service,   
     world, strange, unacquainted: 
   beseech you,     taste, 
  give   a  benefit, 
     register'd  promise, 
 which,  say, live     behalf. 
 agamemnon   wouldst thou  us, trojan?  demand. 
 calchas    a trojan prisoner, call'd antenor, 
 yesterday took: troy holds   dear. 
 oft  you--often    therefore-- 
 desired  cressid   great exchange, 
  troy hath  denied:   antenor, 
  know,   a wrest   affairs 
   negotiations   slack, 
 wanting  manage;     
 give  a prince  blood, a son  priam, 
  change  him:    sent, great princes, 
    buy  daughter;   presence 
   strike   service   done, 
   accepted pain. 
 agamemnon   diomedes bear him, 
  bring  cressid hither: calchas   
   requests  us. good diomed, 
 furnish     interchange: 
 withal bring word  hector  to-morrow 
  answer'd   challenge: ajax  ready. 
 diomedes     undertake;  'tis a burden 
    proud  bear. 

 exeunt diomedes  calchas 
 enter achilles  patroclus,   tent  ulysses  achilles stands i'  entrance   tent: 
    general  pass strangely  him, 
     forgot; and, princes all, 
 lay negligent  loose regard  him: 
    last. 'tis   question  
   unplausive eyes  bent  him: 
  so,   derision medicinable, 
     strangeness   pride, 
       desire  drink: 
    good: pride hath   glass 
  show   pride,  supple knees 
 feed arrogance    proud man's fees. 
 agamemnon   execute  purpose,  put  
 a form  strangeness   pass along: 
    lord,   greet  not, 
   disdainfully,   shake   
    look'd on.   lead  way. 
 achilles  what,   general  speak  me? 
    mind,  fight   'gainst troy. 
 agamemnon    achilles?   aught  us? 
 nestor   you,  lord, aught   general? 
 achilles  no. 
 nestor  nothing,  lord. 
 agamemnon   better. 

 exeunt agamemnon  nestor  achilles  good day, good day. 
 menelaus    you?   you? 

 exit  achilles  what,   cuckold scorn me? 
 ajax   now, patroclus! 
 achilles  good morrow, ajax. 
 ajax  ha? 
 achilles  good morrow. 
 ajax  ay,  good  day too. 

 exit  achilles     fellows?    achilles? 
 patroclus   pass  strangely:     bend 
  send  smiles    achilles; 
    humbly     creep 
  holy altars. 
 achilles  what,   poor  late? 
 'tis certain, greatness,  fall'n   fortune, 
  fall   men too:   declined  
     read   eyes   
  feel    fall;  men,  butterflies, 
 show   mealy wings    summer, 
   a man,   simply man, 
 hath  honour,  honour   honours 
    him,  place, riches, favour, 
 prizes  accident  oft  merit: 
    fall,   slippery standers, 
  love  lean'd    slippery too, 
   pluck     
 die   fall.  'tis    me: 
 fortune    friends:   enjoy 
  ample point     possess, 
 save  men's looks;  do, methinks, find  
   worth    rich beholding 
     given.   ulysses; 
  interrupt  reading. 
   ulysses! 
 ulysses  now, great thetis' son! 
 achilles     reading? 
 ulysses  a strange fellow  
 writes me: ' man,  dearly  parted, 
    having,    in, 
   boast      hath, 
  feels    owes,   reflection; 
    virtues shining   
 heat    retort  heat  
    giver.' 
 achilles     strange, ulysses. 
  beauty   borne    face 
  bearer  not,  commends  
  others' eyes;  doth  eye itself, 
   pure spirit  sense, behold itself, 
    itself;  eye  eye opposed 
 salutes     other's form; 
  speculation turns   itself, 
   hath travell'd   mirror'd  
     itself.    strange  all. 
 ulysses     strain   position,-- 
   familiar,--but   author's drift; 
 who,   circumstance, expressly proves 
      lord   thing, 
         consisting, 
   communicate  parts  others: 
  doth       aught 
   behold  form'd   applause 
   extended; who,   arch, 
 reverberates 
  voice again, or,  a gate  steel 
 fronting  sun, receives  renders  
  figure   heat.     wrapt  this; 
  apprehended  immediately 
  unknown ajax. 
 heavens,  a   there! a  horse, 
      what. nature,     
  abject  regard  dear  use! 
     dear   esteem 
  poor  worth!     to-morrow-- 
     chance doth throw  him-- 
 ajax renown'd. o heavens,   men do, 
   men leave  do! 
   men creep  skittish fortune's hall, 
 whiles  play  idiots   eyes! 
    eats  another's pride, 
  pride  fasting   wantonness! 
    grecian lords!--why,   
  clap  lubber ajax   shoulder, 
    foot   brave hector's breast 
  great troy shrieking. 
 achilles     it;   pass'd   
  misers   beggars,  gave   
 good word  look: what,   deeds forgot? 
 ulysses  time hath,  lord, a wallet   back, 
   puts alms  oblivion, 
 a great-sized monster  ingratitudes: 
  scraps  good deeds past;   devour'd 
  fast    made, forgot   
  done: perseverance, dear  lord, 
  honour bright:      hang 
    fashion,  a rusty mail 
  monumental mockery.   instant way; 
  honour travels  a strait  narrow, 
     abreast:    path; 
  emulation hath a thousand sons 
     pursue:   give way, 
  hedge    direct forthright, 
    enter'd tide,   rush  
  leave  hindmost; 
   a gallant horse fall'n   rank, 
 lie   pavement   abject rear, 
 o'er-run  trampled on:      present, 
      past,  o'ertop yours; 
  time   a fashionable host 
  slightly shakes  parting guest   hand, 
    arms outstretch'd,    fly, 
 grasps   comer:   smiles, 
  farewell   sighing. o,   
 virtue seek 
 remuneration     was; 
  beauty, wit, 
 high birth, vigour  bone, desert  service, 
 love, friendship, charity,  subjects  
  envious  calumniating time. 
  touch  nature    world kin, 
     consent praise new-born gawds, 
      moulded   past, 
  give  dust   a  gilt 
  laud  gilt o'er-dusted. 
  present eye praises  present object. 
  marvel not, thou great  complete man, 
    greeks   worship ajax; 
    motion sooner catch  eye 
    stirs.  cry    thee, 
    might,     again, 
  thou wouldst  entomb thyself alive 
  case thy reputation  thy tent; 
  glorious deeds,    fields  late, 
  emulous missions 'mongst  gods  
  drave great mars  faction. 
 achilles     privacy 
   strong reasons. 
 ulysses   'gainst  privacy 
  reasons   potent  heroical: 
 'tis known, achilles,     love 
    priam's daughters. 
 achilles  ha! known! 
 ulysses    a wonder? 
  providence   a watchful state 
    grain  plutus' gold, 
 finds bottom   uncomprehensive deeps, 
  place  thought  almost,   gods, 
  thoughts unveil   dumb cradles. 
   a mystery--with  relation 
 durst  meddle--in  soul  state; 
  hath  operation  divine 
  breath  pen  give expressure to: 
   commerce      troy 
  perfectly    yours,  lord; 
     fit achilles  
  throw  hector  polyxena: 
    grieve young pyrrhus   home, 
  fame    islands sound  trump, 
    greekish girls  tripping sing, 
 'great hector's sister  achilles win, 
   great ajax bravely beat  him.' 
 farewell,  lord:    lover speak; 
  fool slides o'er  ice    break. 

 exit  patroclus    effect, achilles,   moved you: 
 a woman impudent  mannish grown 
    loathed   effeminate  
  time  action.  stand condemn'd  this; 
     stomach   war 
   great love   restrains  thus: 
 sweet, rouse yourself;   weak wanton cupid 
    neck unloose  amorous fold, 
 and,  a dew-drop   lion's mane, 
  shook  air. 
 achilles   ajax fight  hector? 
 patroclus  ay,   receive  honour  him. 
 achilles     reputation   stake 
  fame  shrewdly gored. 
 patroclus  o, then, beware; 
  wounds heal ill  men  give themselves: 
 omission      
 seals a commission  a blank  danger; 
  danger,   ague, subtly taints 
     sit idly   sun. 
 achilles   call thersites hither, sweet patroclus: 
  send  fool  ajax  desire  
  invite  trojan lords   combat 
     unarm'd:   a woman's longing, 
  appetite    sick withal, 
   great hector   weeds  peace, 
  talk     behold  visage, 
    full  view. 

 enter thersites  a labour saved! 
 thersites  a wonder! 
 achilles  what? 
 thersites  ajax      field,   himself. 
 achilles   so? 
 thersites    fight singly to-morrow  hector,    
 prophetically proud   heroical cudgelling   
 raves   nothing. 
 achilles     be? 
 thersites  why,  stalks     a peacock,--a stride 
  a stand: ruminates   hostess  hath  
 arithmetic   brain  set   reckoning: 
 bites  lip  a politic regard,    
  '  wit   head,  'twould out;' 
    is,   lies  coldly    fire 
  a flint,    show  knocking. 
  man's undone forever;   hector break   
 neck i'  combat,  break 't   
 vain-glory.    me:   'good morrow, 
 ajax;'   replies 'thanks, agamemnon.'   
      takes    general?  
 grown a  land-fish, language-less, a monster. 
 a plague  opinion! a   wear    
 sides,  a leather jerkin. 
 achilles  thou    ambassador  him, thersites. 
 thersites  who, i? why,  answer nobody;  professes  
 answering: speaking   beggars;  wears  
 tongue in's arms.   put   presence:  
 patroclus  demands  me,     
 pageant  ajax. 
 achilles   him, patroclus;    humbly desire  
 valiant ajax  invite   valorous hector 
   unarmed   tent,   procure 
 safe-conduct   person   magnanimous 
   illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured 
 captain-general   grecian army, agamemnon, 
  cetera.  this. 
 patroclus  jove bless great ajax! 
 thersites  hum! 
 patroclus      worthy achilles,-- 
 thersites  ha! 
 patroclus    humbly desires   invite hector   tent,-- 
 thersites  hum! 
 patroclus    procure safe-conduct  agamemnon. 
 thersites  agamemnon! 
 patroclus  ay,  lord. 
 thersites  ha! 
 patroclus     to't? 
 thersites  god b' wi' you,    heart. 
 patroclus   answer, sir. 
 thersites   to-morrow  a fair day,  eleven o'clock   
     other: howsoever,   pay   
 ere   me. 
 patroclus   answer, sir. 
 thersites  fare  well,    heart. 
 achilles  why,       tune,  he? 
 thersites  no,    o' tune thus.  music    
   hector  knocked   brains,   
 not; but,   sure, none,   fiddler apollo 
   sinews   catlings on. 
 achilles  come, thou shalt bear a letter   straight. 
 thersites    bear    horse;     
 capable creature. 
 achilles   mind  troubled,  a fountain stirr'd; 
       bottom  it. 

 exeunt achilles  patroclus  thersites    fountain   mind  clear again, 
    water  ass  it!     a 
 tick  a sheep   a valiant ignorance.
