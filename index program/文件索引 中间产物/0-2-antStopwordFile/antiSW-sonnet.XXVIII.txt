sonnet xxviiisonnet xxviiihow    return  happy plight,
  debarr'd  benefit  rest?
 day's oppression   eased  night,
 day  night,  night  day, oppress'd?
 each,  enemies  either's reign,
  consent shake hands  torture me;
   toil,    complain
   toil,     thee.
   day,    thou art bright
 dost  grace  clouds  blot  heaven:
 flatter   swart-complexion'd night,
 sparkling stars twire  thou gild'st  even.
 day doth daily draw  sorrows longer
 night doth nightly  grief's strength
 stronger.
