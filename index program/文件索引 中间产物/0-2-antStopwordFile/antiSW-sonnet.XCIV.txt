sonnet xcivsonnet xcivthey   power  hurt    none,
         show,
who, moving others,    stone,
unmoved, cold,   temptation slow,
 rightly  inherit heaven's graces
 husband nature's riches  expense;
   lords  owners   faces,
  stewards   excellence.
 summer's flower    summer sweet,
     live  die,
   flower  base infection meet,
 basest weed outbraves  dignity:
 sweetest  turn sourest   deeds;
lilies  fester smell  worse  weeds.
