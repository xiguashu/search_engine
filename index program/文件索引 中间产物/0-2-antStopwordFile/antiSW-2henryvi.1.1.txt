  deeds  war    counsel die? 
 o peers  england, shameful   league! 
 fatal  marriage, cancelling  fame, 
 blotting  names  books  memory, 
 razing  characters   renown, 
 defacing monuments  conquer'd france, 
  all,     been! 
 cardinal  nephew,  means  passionate discourse,

 gloucester,' 
 clapping  hands,  crying  loud voice, 
 'jesu maintain  royal excellence!' 
  'god preserve  good duke humphrey!'

  change  dukedoms  a duke's fair daughter. 
   blame  all:  is't  them? 
 'tis thine  give away,    own. 
 pirates   cheap pennyworths   pillage 
  purchase friends  give  courtezans, 
  revelling  lords    gone;

 weeps    wrings  hapless hands 
  shakes  head  trembling stands aloof, 
    shared    borne away, 
 ready  starve    touch  own:

    lands  bargain'd   sold. 
 methinks  realms  england, france  ireland 
 bear  proportion   flesh  blood 
    fatal brand althaea burn'd 
   prince's heart  calydon. 
 anjou  maine     french!

 and,   spy advantage, claim  crown, 
    golden mark  seek  hit: 
   proud lancaster usurp  right, 
  hold  sceptre   childish fist, 
  wear  diadem   head, 
  church-like humours fits   a crown. 
 then, york,   awhile,  time  serve: 
 watch thou  wake    asleep, 
  pry   secrets   state; 
  henry, surfeiting  joys  love, 
    bride  england's dear-bought queen, 
  humphrey   peers  fall'n  jars: 
    raise aloft  milk-white rose, 
   sweet smell  air   perfumed; 
    standard bear  arms  york 
  grapple   house  lancaster; 
 and, force perforce,    yield  crown, 
  bookish rule hath pull'd fair england down.
