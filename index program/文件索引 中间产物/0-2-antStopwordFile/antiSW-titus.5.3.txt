 lending  kind commiseration. 
   a captain,     tale;

 lucius  then, noble auditory,     you, 
  cursed chiron  demetrius 
    murdered  emperor's brother; 
      ravished  sister: 
   fell faults  brothers  beheaded; 
  father's tears despised,  basely cozen'd

 stand  aloof: but, uncle, draw  near, 
  shed obsequious tears   trunk. 
 o,   warm kiss  thy pale cold lips, 

 kissing titus   sorrowful drops  thy blood-stain'd face,

 thy brother marcus tenders  thy lips: 
 o   sum      pay 
 countless  infinite,    pay them! 
 lucius   hither, boy; come, come,  learn   
  melt  showers: thy grandsire loved thee well: 
  a time  danced thee   knee, 
 sung thee asleep,  loving breast thy pillow: 
  a matter hath  told  thee, 
 meet  agreeing  thine infancy; 
   respect, then,  a loving child, 
 shed   small drops  thy tender spring, 
  kind nature doth require  so: 
 friends  associate friends  grief  woe: 
 bid  farewell; commit    grave; 
    kindness,   leave  him.

    stand,  rave,  cry  food; 
    relieves  pities him, 
   offence  dies.    doom: 
  stay    fasten'd   earth. 
 aaron  o,   wrath  mute,  fury dumb?

   repent     soul. 
 lucius   loving friends convey  emperor hence, 
  give  burial   father's grave: 
  father  lavinia  forthwith 
  closed   household's monument. 
    heinous tiger, tamora, 
  funeral rite,    mourning weeds, 
  mournful bell  ring  burial; 
  throw    beasts  birds  prey: 
  life  beast-like,  devoid  pity; 
 and,  so,      pity. 
  justice   aaron,  damn'd moor, 
    heavy haps   beginning: 
 then, afterwards,  order   state, 
   events  ne'er  ruinate.
