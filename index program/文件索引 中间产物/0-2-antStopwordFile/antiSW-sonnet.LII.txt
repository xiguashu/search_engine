sonnet liisonnet liiso     rich,  blessed key
 bring    sweet up-locked treasure,
      hour survey,
 blunting  fine point  seldom pleasure.
  feasts  solemn   rare,
since, seldom coming,   long year set,
 stones  worth  thinly  are,
 captain jewels   carcanet.
   time      chest,
   wardrobe   robe doth hide,
   special instant special blest,
  unfolding  imprison'd pride.
blessed  you,  worthiness  scope,
 had,  triumph,  lack'd,  hope.
