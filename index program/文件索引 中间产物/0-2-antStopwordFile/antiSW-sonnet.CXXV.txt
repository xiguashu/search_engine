sonnet cxxvsonnet cxxvwere 't aught    bore  canopy,
  extern  outward honouring,
 laid great bases  eternity,
 prove  short  waste  ruining?
    dwellers  form  favour
lose all,  more,  paying   rent,
 compound sweet forgoing simple savour,
pitiful thrivers,   gazing spent?
no,    obsequious  thy heart,
  thou  oblation, poor  free,
   mix'd  seconds,   art,
 mutual render,    thee.
hence, thou suborn'd informer! a true soul
  impeach'd stands   thy control.
