    |      iii.  grecian camp.  agamemnon's tent. 
 sennet. enter agamemnon, nestor, ulysses, menelaus,    agamemnon  princes, 
  grief hath set  jaundice   cheeks? 
  ample proposition  hope  
   designs begun  earth  
 fails   promised largeness: cheques  disasters 
 grow   veins  actions highest rear'd, 
  knots,   conflux  meeting sap, 
 infect  sound pine  divert  grain 
 tortive  errant     growth. 
 nor, princes,   matter    
    short   suppose   
    years' siege  troy walls stand; 
 sith  action  hath  before, 
 whereof   record, trial  draw 
 bias  thwart,  answering  aim, 
   unbodied figure   thought 
  gave't surmised shape.  then,  princes, 
    cheeks abash'd behold  works, 
  call  shames?    nought  
   protractive trials  great jove 
  find persistive constancy  men: 
  fineness   metal    
  fortune's love;    bold  coward, 
  wise  fool,  artist  unread, 
  hard  soft   affined  kin: 
 but,   wind  tempest   frown, 
 distinction,  a broad  powerful fan, 
 puffing  all, winnows  light away; 
   hath mass  matter,   
 lies rich  virtue  unmingled. 
 nestor   due observance  thy godlike seat, 
 great agamemnon, nestor  apply 
 thy latest words.   reproof  chance 
 lies  true proof  men:  sea  smooth, 
   shallow bauble boats  sail 
   patient breast, making   
    nobler bulk! 
    ruffian boreas  enrage 
  gentle thetis,  anon behold 
  strong-ribb'd bark  liquid mountains cut, 
 bounding    moist elements, 
  perseus' horse:    saucy boat 
  weak untimber'd sides    
 co-rivall'd greatness?   harbour fled, 
   a toast  neptune.   
 doth valour's show  valour's worth divide 
  storms  fortune;    ray  brightness 
  herd hath  annoyance   breeze 
    tiger;    splitting wind 
  flexible  knees  knotted oaks, 
  flies fled  shade, why,     courage 
  roused  rage  rage doth sympathize, 
    accent tuned  selfsame key 
 retorts  chiding fortune. 
 ulysses  agamemnon,

  venerable nestor, hatch'd  silver, 
   a bond  air, strong   axle-tree 
   heaven rides, knit   greekish ears 
   experienced tongue,     both, 
 thou great,  wise,  hear ulysses speak. 
 agamemnon  speak, prince  ithaca;  be't   expect 
  matter needless,  importless burden, 
 divide thy lips,    confident, 
  rank thersites opes  mastic jaws, 
   hear music, wit  oracle. 
 ulysses  troy,    basis,   down, 
   great hector's sword  lack'd a master, 
    instances. 
  specialty  rule hath  neglected: 
 and, look,   grecian tents  stand 
 hollow   plain,   hollow factions.

     glorious planet sol 
  noble eminence enthroned  sphered

 sans cheque  good  bad:    planets 
  evil mixture  disorder wander,

 divert  crack, rend  deracinate

    fixure! o,  degree  shaked, 
    ladder   high designs,

   degree away, untune  string, 
 and, hark,  discord follows!   meets 
  mere oppugnancy:  bounded waters 
  lift  bosoms higher   shores 
   a sop    solid globe:

   rude son  strike  father dead:

  chaos,  degree  suffocate, 
   choking. 
   neglection  degree   
   a pace  backward,  a purpose 
  hath  climb.  general's disdain'd 
    step below,    next, 
     beneath;   step, 
 exampled    pace   sick 
   superior, grows   envious fever 
  pale  bloodless emulation: 
  'tis  fever   troy  foot, 
    sinews.   a tale  length, 
 troy   weakness stands,    strength. 
 nestor   wisely hath ulysses  discover'd 
  fever whereof   power  sick. 
 agamemnon   nature   sickness found, ulysses, 
    remedy? 
 ulysses   great achilles,  opinion crowns 
  sinew   forehand   host, 
   ear full   airy fame, 
 grows dainty   worth,    tent 
 lies mocking  designs:   patroclus 
  a lazy bed  livelong day 
 breaks scurril jests; 
   ridiculous  awkward action, 
 which, slanderer,  imitation calls, 
  pageants us. sometime, great agamemnon, 
 thy topless deputation  puts on, 
 and,  a strutting player,  conceit 
 lies   hamstring,  doth   rich 
  hear  wooden dialogue  sound 
 'twixt  stretch'd footing   scaffoldage,-- 
  to-be-pitied  o'er-wrested  
  acts thy greatness in:    speaks, 
 'tis  a chime a-mending;  terms unsquared, 
 which,   tongue  roaring typhon dropp'd 
   hyperboles.   fusty stuff 
  large achilles,   press'd bed lolling, 
   deep chest laughs  a loud applause; 
 cries 'excellent! 'tis agamemnon just. 
  play  nestor; hem,  stroke thy beard, 
    drest   oration.' 
  done,     extremest ends 
  parallels,    vulcan   wife: 
  god achilles  cries 'excellent! 
 'tis nestor right.  play  me, patroclus, 
 arming  answer  a night alarm.' 
  then, forsooth,  faint defects  age 
      mirth;  cough  spit, 
 and,  a palsy-fumbling   gorget, 
 shake     rivet:    sport 
 sir valour dies; cries 'o, enough, patroclus; 
  give  ribs  steel!   split  
  pleasure   spleen.'    fashion,

 severals  generals  grace exact, 
 achievements, plots, orders, preventions,

 success  loss,     not, serves

 nestor     imitation   twain-- 
 who,  ulysses says, opinion crowns 
   imperial voice--many  infect. 
 ajax  grown self-will'd,  bears  head 
   a rein,  full  proud a place 
  broad achilles;   tent  him; 
  factious feasts; rails   state  war, 
 bold   oracle,  sets thersites, 
 a slave  gall coins slanders  a mint, 
  match   comparisons  dirt,

 ulysses   tax  policy,  call  cowardice, 
 count wisdom   member   war, 
 forestall prescience,  esteem   
    hand:    mental parts, 
   contrive   hands  strike, 
  fitness calls  on,    measure 
   observant toil  enemies' weight,-- 
 why,  hath  a finger's dignity: 
  call  bed-work, mappery, closet-war; 
    ram  batters   wall,

  place   hand    engine,

 nestor     granted,  achilles' horse 
   thetis' sons. 

 a tucket  agamemnon   trumpet? look, menelaus. 
 menelaus   troy. 

 enter aeneas  agamemnon     'fore  tent? 
 aeneas    great agamemnon's tent,  pray you? 
 agamemnon   this. 
 aeneas   one,   a herald  a prince, 
  a fair message   kingly ears? 
 agamemnon   surety stronger  achilles' arm 
 'fore   greekish heads,    voice 
 call agamemnon head  general. 
 aeneas  fair leave  large security.   
 a stranger    imperial  
    eyes   mortals? 
 agamemnon  how! 
 aeneas  ay; 
  ask,    waken reverence, 
  bid  cheek  ready  a blush 
 modest  morning   coldly eyes 
  youthful phoebus: 
    god  office, guiding men? 
    high  mighty agamemnon? 
 agamemnon   trojan scorns us;   men  troy 
  ceremonious courtiers. 
 aeneas  courtiers  free,  debonair, unarm'd, 
  bending angels;   fame  peace: 
      soldiers,   galls, 
 good arms, strong joints, true swords; and, 
 jove's accord, 
   full  heart.  peace, aeneas, 
 peace, trojan; lay thy finger  thy lips! 
  worthiness  praise distains  worth, 
    praised  bring  praise forth: 
    repining enemy commends, 
  breath fame blows;  praise, sole sure, 
 transcends. 
 agamemnon  sir,   troy, call   aeneas? 
 aeneas  ay, greek,    name. 
 agamemnon    affair  pray you? 
 aeneas  sir, pardon; 'tis  agamemnon's ears. 
 agamemnon   hears naught privately    troy. 
 aeneas     troy    whisper him: 
  bring a trumpet  awake  ear, 
  set  sense   attentive bent, 
    speak. 
 agamemnon  speak frankly   wind; 
    agamemnon's sleeping hour: 
  thou shalt know. trojan,   awake, 
  tells thee  himself. 
 aeneas  trumpet, blow loud, 
 send thy brass voice    lazy tents; 
   greek  mettle,   know, 
  troy means    spoke aloud. 

 trumpet sounds   have, great agamemnon,   troy 
 a prince call'd hector,--priam   father,-- 
    dull  long-continued truce 
  rusty grown:  bade   a trumpet, 
    purpose speak. kings, princes, lords! 
       fair'st  greece 
  holds  honour higher   ease, 
  seeks  praise    fears  peril, 
    valour,     fear, 
  loves  mistress    confession, 
  truant vows    lips  loves, 
   avow  beauty   worth 
   arms  hers,--to   challenge. 
 hector,  view  trojans   greeks, 
    good,       it, 
  hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer, 
   greek  compass   arms, 
   to-morrow   trumpet call 
 midway   tents  walls  troy, 
  rouse a grecian   true  love: 
   come, hector  honour him; 
  none,    troy   retires, 
  grecian dames  sunburnt   worth 
  splinter  a lance.   much. 
 agamemnon     told  lovers, lord aeneas; 
      soul   a kind, 
  left    home:    soldiers; 
    soldier a mere recreant prove, 
  means not, hath not,     love! 
    is,  hath,  means  be, 
   meets hector;   else,   he. 
 nestor     nestor,    a

  fairer   grandam   chaste 
      world:  youth  flood,

 aeneas   heavens forbid  scarcity  youth! 
 ulysses  amen. 
 agamemnon  fair lord aeneas,   touch  hand; 
   pavilion   lead you, sir. 
 achilles   word   intent; 
    lord  greece,  tent  tent: 
   feast      
  find    a noble foe. 

 exeunt   ulysses  nestor  ulysses  nestor! 
 nestor    ulysses? 
 ulysses    a young conception   brain; 
    time  bring    shape. 
 nestor   is't? 
 ulysses   'tis: 
 blunt wedges rive hard knots:  seeded pride 
  hath   maturity blown  
  rank achilles     cropp'd, 
 or, shedding, breed a nursery   evil, 
  overbulk  all. 
 nestor  well,  how? 
 ulysses   challenge   gallant hector sends, 
    spread  general name, 
 relates  purpose   achilles. 
 nestor   purpose  perspicuous   substance, 
  grossness  characters sum up: 
 and,   publication,   strain, 
   achilles,   brain  barren 
  banks  libya,--though, apollo knows, 
 'tis dry enough,--will,  great speed  judgment, 
 ay,  celerity, find hector's purpose 
 pointing  him. 
 ulysses   wake    answer,  you? 
 nestor  yes, 'tis  meet:     oppose, 
    hector bring  honour off, 
   achilles? though't  a sportful combat, 
    trial  opinion dwells; 
    trojans taste  dear'st repute 
   finest palate:  trust  me, ulysses, 
  imputation   oddly poised 
   wild action;   success, 
  particular,  give a scantling 
  good  bad   general; 
    indexes,  small pricks 
   subsequent volumes,    
  baby figure   giant mass 
      large.   supposed 
   meets hector issues   choice 
  choice,  mutual     souls,

  'twere   all, a  distill'd

  heart receives    conquering part, 
  steel a strong opinion  themselves? 
  entertain'd, limbs   instruments, 
    working   swords  bows 
 directive   limbs. 
 ulysses  give pardon   speech: 
  'tis meet achilles meet  hector. 
  us,  merchants, show  foulest wares, 
  think, perchance,  sell;  not, 
  lustre      show, 
  show  better.   consent 
   hector  achilles meet; 
    honour   shame   
  dogg'd   strange followers. 
 nestor         eyes:   they? 
 ulysses   glory  achilles shares  hector, 
    proud,    share  him: 
      insolent; 
 a     parch  afric sun 
    pride  salt scorn   eyes, 
   'scape hector fair:    foil'd, 
  then,    main opinion crush 
  taint    man. no,  a lottery; 
 and,  device,  blockish ajax draw 
  sort  fight  hector:   
 give  allowance    man; 
    physic  great myrmidon 
  broils  loud applause,    fall

   dull brainless ajax  safe off,

     men. but, hit  miss, 
  project's life  shape  sense assumes: 
 ajax employ'd plucks  achilles' plumes. 
 nestor  ulysses, 
     relish thy advice; 
    give a taste   forthwith 
  agamemnon:     straight.
