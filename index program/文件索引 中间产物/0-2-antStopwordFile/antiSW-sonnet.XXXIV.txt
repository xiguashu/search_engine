sonnet xxxivsonnet xxxivwhy didst thou promise  a beauteous day,
   travel    cloak,
  base clouds o'ertake    way,
hiding thy bravery   rotten smoke?
'tis      cloud thou break,
 dry  rain   storm-beaten face,
      a salve  speak
 heals  wound  cures   disgrace:
  thy shame give physic   grief;
 thou repent,      loss:
 offender's sorrow lends  weak relief
   bears  strong offence's cross.
ah!   tears  pearl  thy love sheds,
   rich  ransom  ill deeds.
