sonnet xxisonnet xxiso         muse
stirr'd  a painted beauty   verse,
 heaven   ornament doth 
  fair   fair doth rehearse
making a couplement  proud compare,
 sun  moon,  earth  sea's rich gems,
 april's first-born flowers,    rare
 heaven's air   huge rondure hems.
o'  me, true  love,   write,
   me,  love   fair
  mother's child,    bright
  gold candles fix'd  heaven's air:
       hearsay well;
   praise  purpose   sell.
