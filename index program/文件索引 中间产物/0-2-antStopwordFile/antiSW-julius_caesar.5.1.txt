    enemy    down, 
    hills  upper regions; 
  proves  so:  battles   hand;

 answering    demand  them. 
 antony  tut,     bosoms,    
 wherefore   it:    content 
  visit  places;    
  fearful bravery, thinking   face 
  fasten   thoughts    courage; 
  'tis  so.

 octavius     love words better,   do. 
 brutus  good words    bad strokes, octavius. 
 antony    bad strokes, brutus,  give good words: 
 witness  hole    caesar's heart, 
 crying 'long live! hail, caesar!' 
 cassius  antony, 
  posture   blows   unknown; 
    words,  rob  hybla bees, 
  leave  honeyless. 
 antony   stingless too. 
 brutus  o, yes,  soundless too; 
    stol'n  buzzing, antony, 
   wisely threat   sting. 
 antony  villains,    so,   vile daggers 
 hack'd     sides  caesar: 
  show'd  teeth  apes,  fawn'd  hounds, 
  bow'd  bondmen, kissing caesar's feet; 
  damned casca,  a cur,  
 struck caesar   neck. o  flatterers! 
 cassius  flatterers! now, brutus,  yourself: 
  tongue   offended  to-day, 
  cassius   ruled. 
 octavius  come, come,  cause:  arguing   sweat, 
  proof    turn  redder drops. look; 
  draw a sword  conspirators; 
      sword   again? 
 never,  caesar's    wounds 
   avenged;    caesar 
  added slaughter   sword  traitors. 
 brutus  caesar, thou canst  die  traitors' hands, 
  thou bring'st   thee. 
 octavius    hope; 
    born  die  brutus' sword. 
 brutus  o,  thou wert  noblest  thy strain, 
 young man, thou couldst  die  honourable. 
 cassius  a peevish schoolboy, worthless   honour, 
 join'd  a masker  a reveller! 
 antony   cassius still! 
 octavius  come, antony, away! 
 defiance, traitors, hurl    teeth: 
    fight to-day,    field; 
  not,    stomachs. 

 exeunt octavius, antony,   army  cassius  why, now, blow wind, swell billow  swim bark! 
  storm  up,      hazard. 
 brutus  ho, lucilius! hark, a word  you. 
 lucilius  [standing forth]	 lord? 

 brutus  lucilius converse   cassius  messala! 
 messala  [standing forth]     general? 
 cassius  messala, 
    birth-day;    day 
  cassius born. give  thy hand, messala: 
  thou  witness    will, 
  pompey was,   compell'd  set 
   battle   liberties. 
     held epicurus strong 
   opinion:   change  mind, 
  partly credit    presage. 
 coming  sardis,    ensign 
  mighty eagles fell,    perch'd, 
 gorging  feeding   soldiers' hands; 
   philippi  consorted us: 
  morning   fled   gone; 
    steads  ravens, crows  kites, 
 fly o'er  heads  downward   us, 
    sickly prey:  shadows  
 a canopy  fatal,   
  army lies, ready  give   ghost. 
 messala    so. 
 cassius      partly; 
    fresh  spirit  resolved 
  meet  perils  constantly. 
 brutus   so, lucilius. 
 cassius  now,  noble brutus, 
  gods to-day stand friendly,   may, 
 lovers  peace, lead   days  age! 
    affairs  men rest  incertain, 
  reason   worst   befall. 
    lose  battle,    
    time   speak together: 
     determined  do? 
 brutus     rule   philosophy 
     blame cato   death 
    give himself,    how, 
    find  cowardly  vile, 
  fear    fall,   prevent 
  time  life: arming   patience 
  stay  providence   high powers 
  govern  below. 
 cassius  then,   lose  battle, 
   contented   led  triumph 
   streets  rome? 
 brutus  no, cassius, no:  not, thou noble roman, 
   brutus   bound  rome; 
  bears  great a mind.    day 
    work  ides  march begun; 
     meet    not. 
   everlasting farewell take: 
  ever,   ever, farewell, cassius! 
    meet again, why,   smile; 
  not,  then,  parting   made. 
 cassius   ever,   ever, farewell, brutus! 
    meet again,  smile indeed; 
  not, 'tis true  parting   made. 
 brutus  why, then, lead on. o,  a    
     day's business ere  come! 
   sufficeth   day  end, 
      known. come, ho! away!
