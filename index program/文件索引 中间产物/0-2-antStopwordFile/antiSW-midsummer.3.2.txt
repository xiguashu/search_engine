  sisters' vows,  hours    spent, 
    chid  hasty-footed time 
  parting us,--o,    forgot? 
  school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?

 due     crowned   crest. 
    rent  ancient love asunder, 
  join  men  scorning  poor friend? 
    friendly, 'tis  maidenly: 
  sex,    i,  chide   it, 
     feel  injury. 
 hermia    amazed   passionate words. 
  scorn  not:     scorn me.

  call  goddess, nymph, divine  rare, 
 precious, celestial? wherefore speaks

  thought      grace  you, 
  hung   love,  fortunate, 
  miserable most,  love unloved?

 hernia   understand      this. 
 helena  ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks, 
  mouths     turn  back; 
 wink   other; hold  sweet jest up: 
  sport,  carried,   chronicled. 
     pity, grace,  manners,

  fare ye well: 'tis partly   fault; 
  death  absence   remedy. 
 lysander  stay, gentle helena; hear  excuse: 
  love,  life  soul, fair helena! 
 helena  o excellent! 
 hermia  sweet,   scorn  so. 
 demetrius     entreat,   compel. 
 lysander  thou canst compel     entreat: 
 thy threats    strength   weak prayers. 
 helen,  love thee;   life,  do: 
  swear      lose  thee, 
  prove  false    love thee not. 
 demetrius     love thee     do.

 demetrius  quick, come! 
 hermia  lysander, whereto   this? 
 lysander  away,  ethiope! 
 demetrius  no, no;  [        ] 
   break loose;      follow, 
    not:   a tame man, go! 
 lysander  hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing,  loose, 
    shake thee    a serpent! 
 hermia     grown  rude?  change  this?

 out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence! 
 hermia     jest? 
 helena  yes, sooth;    you.

 demetrius       bond,   perceive 
 a weak bond holds you:   trust  word.
