sonnet xcisonnet xcisome glory   birth,    skill,
   wealth,    bodies' force,
   garments,  new-fangled ill,
   hawks  hounds,    horse;
  humour hath  adjunct pleasure,
  finds a joy   rest:
  particulars    measure;
      general best.
thy love    high birth  me,
richer  wealth, prouder  garments' cost,
  delight  hawks  horses be;
  thee,   men's pride  boast:
wretched   alone,  thou mayst 
      wretched make.
