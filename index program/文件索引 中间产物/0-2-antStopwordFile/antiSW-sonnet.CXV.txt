sonnet cxvsonnet cxvthose lines     writ  lie,
       love  dearer:
   judgment knew  reason 
  full flame   burn clearer.
 reckoning time,  million'd accidents
creep  'twixt vows  change decrees  kings,
tan sacred beauty, blunt  sharp'st intents,
divert strong minds     altering things;
alas, why, fearing  time's tyranny,
     '  love  best,'
    o'er incertainty,
crowning  present, doubting   rest?
love  a babe;      so,
 give full growth     doth grow?
