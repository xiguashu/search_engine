sonnet cxlviisonnet cxlviimy love   a fever, longing 
   longer nurseth  disease,
feeding    doth preserve  ill,
 uncertain sickly appetite  please.
 reason,  physician   love,
angry   prescriptions   kept,
hath left me,   desperate  approve
desire  death,  physic  except.
 cure  am,  reason   care,
 frantic-mad   unrest;
 thoughts   discourse  madmen's are,
 random   truth vainly express'd;
   sworn thee fair  thought thee bright,
 art  black  hell,  dark  night.
