sonnet cxivsonnet cxivor  doth  mind,  crown'd  you,
drink   monarch's plague,  flattery?
    say,  eye saith true,
   love taught   alchemy,
   monsters   indigest
 cherubins   sweet  resemble,
creating  bad a perfect best,
 fast  objects   beams assemble?
o,'tis  first; 'tis flattery   seeing,
  great mind  kingly drinks  up:
 eye      gust  'greeing,
   palate doth prepare  cup:
   poison'd, 'tis  lesser sin
  eye loves   doth  begin.
