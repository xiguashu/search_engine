 cranmer enters  approaches  council-table  chancellor   good lord archbishop,    
  sit    present,  behold 
  chair stand empty:     men, 
    natures frail,  capable 
   flesh;   angels:    frailty 
    wisdom, you,    teach us, 
  misdemean'd yourself,   a little, 
   king first,   laws,  filling 
   realm,   teaching   chaplains, 
     inform'd,   opinions, 
 divers  dangerous;   heresies, 
 and,  reform'd,  prove pernicious. 
 gardiner   reformation   sudden too, 
  noble lords;    tame wild horses 
 pace 'em    hands   'em gentle, 
  stop  mouths  stubborn bits,  spur 'em, 
   obey  manage.   suffer, 
    easiness  childish pity 
   man's honour,  contagious sickness, 
 farewell  physic:    then? 
 commotions, uproars,  a general taint 
    state: as,  late days,  neighbours, 
  upper germany,  dearly witness, 
  freshly pitied   memories. 
 cranmer   good lords, hitherto,    progress 
    life  office,   labour'd, 
     study,   teaching 
   strong    authority 
    way,  safely;

 a    detests,  stirs against, 
    private conscience   place, 
 defacers  a public peace,   do. 
 pray heaven,  king   find a heart 
   allegiance  it! men   
 envy  crooked malice nourishment 
  bite  best.   beseech  lordships, 
 that,   case  justice,  accusers, 
    will,  stand  face  face, 
  freely urge  me. 
 suffolk  nay,  lord, 
   be:   a counsellor, 
 and,   virtue,    accuse you. 
 gardiner   lord,    business   moment, 
    short  you. 'tis  highness' pleasure, 
   consent,   trial  you, 
     committed   tower; 
 where,   a private  again,

     good friend;    pass, 
    find  lordship judge  juror, 
    merciful:    end; 
 'tis  undoing: love  meekness, lord,

 win straying souls  modesty again, 
 cast  away.    clear myself, 
 lay   weight ye    patience, 
     doubt,    conscience 
   daily wrongs.    more, 
  reverence   calling   modest. 
 gardiner   lord,  lord,   a sectary, 
   plain truth:  painted gloss discovers, 
  men  understand you, words  weakness. 
 cromwell   lord  winchester,   a little, 
   good favour,  sharp; men  noble, 
  faulty,   find respect 
     been: 'tis a cruelty 
  load a falling man. 
 gardiner  good master secretary, 
  cry  honour mercy;  may, worst 
    table,  so. 
 cromwell  why,  lord? 
 gardiner        a favourer 
    sect? ye   sound. 
 cromwell   sound? 
 gardiner   sound,  say. 
 cromwell       honest! 
 men's prayers   seek you,   fears. 
 gardiner    remember  bold language. 
 cromwell  do. 
 remember  bold life too.

  virtue   ring,     
    gripes  cruel men,  give  
  a  noble judge,  king  master. 
 chamberlain     king's ring. 
 surrey  'tis  counterfeit. 
 suffolk  'tis   ring,  heaven:  told ye all, 
  ye  put  dangerous stone a-rolling, 
 'twould fall  ourselves. 
 norfolk    think,  lords, 
  king  suffer    finger 
      vex'd? 
 chancellor  'tis   certain: 
      life    him?

    wagging   tongue  win me; 
 but, whatsoe'er thou takest  for,   
 thou hast a cruel nature  a bloody. 

  cranmer  good man, sit down.      proudest 
 he,  dares most,  wag  finger  thee: 
    holy,    starve 
      place  thee not.
