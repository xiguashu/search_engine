 shylock   patch  kind enough,  a huge feeder; 
 snail-slow  profit,   sleeps  day 
    wild-cat: drones hive   me; 
   part  him,  part   
         waste 
  borrow'd purse. well, jessica,  in; 
    return immediately: 
    bid you; shut doors  you: 
 fast bind, fast find; 
 a proverb  stale  thrifty mind. 

 exit  jessica  farewell;    fortune   crost, 
   a father,  a daughter, lost.
