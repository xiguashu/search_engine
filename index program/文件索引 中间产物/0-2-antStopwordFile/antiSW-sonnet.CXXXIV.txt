sonnet cxxxivsonnet cxxxivso,    confess'd    thine,
    mortgaged  thy will,
  forfeit,    
thou wilt restore,    comfort still:
 thou wilt not,      free,
 thou art covetous    kind;
 learn'd  surety-like  write  
  bond    fast doth bind.
 statute  thy beauty thou wilt take,
thou usurer,  put'st    use,
 sue a friend  debtor   sake;
   lose   unkind abuse.
   lost; thou hast    me:
 pays  whole,      free.
