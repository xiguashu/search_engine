sonnet cxxxviiisonnet cxxxviiiwhen  love swears      truth
   her,     lies,
      untutor'd youth,
unlearned   world's false subtleties.
 vainly thinking   thinks  young,
    days    best,
simply  credit  false speaking tongue:
  sides   simple truth suppress'd.
 wherefore      unjust?
 wherefore       old?
o, love's  habit    trust,
 age  love loves    years told:
  lie      me,
   faults  lies  flatter'd be.
