 enter lucentio, hortensio,  bianca  lucentio  fiddler, forbear;  grow  forward, sir: 
     forgot  entertainment 
  sister katharina welcomed  withal? 
 hortensio  but, wrangling pedant,   
  patroness  heavenly harmony: 
  give  leave   prerogative; 
    music   spent  hour, 
  lecture   leisure   much. 
 lucentio  preposterous ass,   read   
      music  ordain'd! 
     refresh  mind   
   studies   usual pain? 
  give  leave  read philosophy, 
    pause, serve   harmony. 
 hortensio  sirrah,    bear  braves  thine. 
 bianca  why, gentlemen,    double wrong, 
  strive    resteth   choice: 
    breeching scholar   schools; 
    tied  hours  'pointed times, 
  learn  lessons    myself. 
 and,  cut   strife,  sit  down: 
    instrument, play   whiles; 
  lecture    ere   tuned. 
 hortensio   leave  lecture     tune? 
 lucentio     never: tune  instrument. 
 bianca   left  last? 
 lucentio  here, madam: 
 'hic ibat simois; hic est sigeia tellus; 
 hic steterat priami regia celsa senis.' 
 bianca  construe them. 
 lucentio  'hic ibat,'   told  before, 'simois,'   
 lucentio, 'hic est,' son  vincentio  pisa, 
 'sigeia tellus,' disguised     love; 
 'hic steterat,'   lucentio   
 a-wooing, 'priami,'    tranio, 'regia,' 
 bearing  port, 'celsa senis,'    
 beguile   pantaloon. 
 hortensio  madam,  instrument's  tune. 
 bianca   hear. o fie!  treble jars. 
 lucentio  spit   hole, man,  tune again. 
 bianca         construe it: 'hic ibat 
 simois,'    not, 'hic est sigeia tellus,'  
 trust  not; 'hic steterat priami,'  heed 
  hear  not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,' 
 despair not. 
 hortensio  madam, 'tis   tune. 
 lucentio     base. 
 hortensio   base  right; 'tis  base knave  jars. 

    fiery    pedant is! 
 now,   life,  knave doth court  love: 
 pedascule,  watch   yet. 
 bianca   time   believe,   mistrust. 
 lucentio  mistrust  not: for, sure, aeacides 
  ajax, call'd    grandfather. 
 bianca      master; else,  promise you, 
    arguing    doubt: 
    rest. now, licio,  you: 
 good masters,    unkindly, pray, 
      pleasant   both. 
 hortensio     walk,  give  leave a while: 
  lessons   music   parts. 
 lucentio     formal, sir? well,   wait, 

    watch withal; for,    deceived, 
  fine musician groweth amorous. 
 hortensio  madam,   touch  instrument, 
  learn  order   fingering, 
     rudiments  art; 
  teach  gamut  a briefer sort, 
  pleasant, pithy  effectual, 
  hath  taught     trade: 
      writing,  drawn. 
 bianca  why,     gamut long ago. 
 hortensio   read  gamut  hortensio. 
 bianca  [reads]  ''gamut'  am,  ground   accord, 
 'a re,'  plead hortensio's passion; 
 'b mi,' bianca,    thy lord, 
 'c fa ut,'  loves   affection: 
 'd sol re,'  clef,  notes  i: 
 'e la mi,' show pity,   die.' 
 call   gamut? tut,    not: 
  fashions   best;     nice, 
  change true rules   inventions. 

 enter a servant  servant  mistress,  father prays  leave  books

 methinks        love: 
   thy thoughts, bianca,   humble 
  cast thy wandering eyes   stale, 
 seize thee  list:    find thee ranging, 
 hortensio   quit  thee  changing.
