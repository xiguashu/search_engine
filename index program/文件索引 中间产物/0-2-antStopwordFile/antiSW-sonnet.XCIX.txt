sonnet xcixsonnet xcixthe  violet    chide:
sweet thief,  didst thou steal thy sweet  smells,
    love's breath?  purple pride
  thy soft cheek  complexion dwells
  love's veins thou hast  grossly dyed.
 lily  condemned  thy hand,
 buds  marjoram  stol'n thy hair:
 roses fearfully  thorns  stand,
 blushing shame,  white despair;
a third,  red  white,  stol'n  
   robbery  annex'd thy breath;
but,   theft,  pride    growth
a vengeful canker eat    death.
 flowers  noted,     
 sweet  colour   stol'n  thee.
