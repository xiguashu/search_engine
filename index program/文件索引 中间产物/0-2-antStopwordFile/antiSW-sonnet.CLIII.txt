sonnet cliiisonnet cliiicupid laid   brand,  fell asleep:
a maid  dian's  advantage found,
  love-kindling fire  quickly steep
 a cold valley-fountain   ground;
 borrow'd   holy fire  love
a dateless lively heat,   endure,
 grew a seething bath,   men prove
 strange maladies a sovereign cure.
   mistress' eye love's brand new-fired,
 boy  trial   touch  breast;
i, sick withal,    bath desired,
 thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,
   cure:  bath    lies
 cupid   fire--my mistress' eyes.
