sonnet lxviiisonnet lxviiithus   cheek  map  days outworn,
 beauty lived  died  flowers  now,
  bastard signs  fair  born,
 durst inhabit  a living brow;
  golden tresses   dead,
   sepulchres,  shorn away,
 live a  life   head;
ere beauty's dead fleece   gay:
   holy antique hours  seen,
  ornament,   true,
making  summer  another's green,
robbing    dress  beauty new;
    a map doth nature store,
 show false art  beauty   yore.
