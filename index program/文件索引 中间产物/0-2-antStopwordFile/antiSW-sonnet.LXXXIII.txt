sonnet lxxxiiisonnet lxxxiiii      painting 
    fair  painting set;
 found,  thought  found,   exceed
 barren tender  a poet's debt;
    slept   report,
    extant   show
  a modern quill doth   short,
speaking  worth,  worth   doth grow.
 silence   sin   impute,
     glory,  dumb;
  impair  beauty  mute,
   give life  bring a tomb.
 lives  life     fair eyes
   poets   praise devise.
