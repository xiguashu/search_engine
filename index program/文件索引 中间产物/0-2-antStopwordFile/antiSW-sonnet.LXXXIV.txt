sonnet lxxxivsonnet lxxxivwho     most?    
  rich praise,     you?
  confine immured   store
     equal grew.
lean penury   pen doth dwell
   subject lends   small glory;
   writes  you,    
   you,  dignifies  story,
   copy     writ,
 making worse  nature   clear,
  a counterpart  fame  wit,
making  style admired  where.
   beauteous blessings add a curse,
 fond  praise,    praises worse.
