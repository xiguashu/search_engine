     ado   myself. 
 salarino   mind  tossing   ocean; 
 there,   argosies  portly sail, 
  signiors  rich burghers   flood, 
 or,   were,  pageants   sea, 
  overpeer  petty traffickers, 
  curtsy  them,   reverence, 
   fly     woven wings.

   part   affections  
    hopes abroad.     
 plucking  grass,    sits  wind, 
 peering  maps  ports  piers  roads;

 misfortune   ventures,   doubt 
    sad. 
 salarino   wind cooling  broth 
  blow    ague,   thought 
  harm a wind  great  sea  do. 
      sandy hour-glass run, 
      shallows   flats, 
    wealthy andrew dock'd  sand, 
 vailing  high-top    ribs 
  kiss  burial.     church 
    holy edifice  stone, 
   bethink  straight  dangerous rocks, 
  touching   gentle vessel's side, 
  scatter   spices   stream, 
 enrobe  roaring waters   silks, 
 and,  a word,    worth this, 
   worth nothing?     thought

    show  teeth    smile, 
  nestor swear  jest  laughable.
