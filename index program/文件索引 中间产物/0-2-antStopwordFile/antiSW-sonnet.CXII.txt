sonnet cxiisonnet cxiiyour love  pity doth  impression fill
 vulgar scandal stamp'd   brow;
  care   calls    ill,
  o'er-green  bad,  good allow?
     world,    strive
   shames  praises   tongue:
   me,     alive,
  steel'd sense     wrong.
  profound abysm  throw  care
 others' voices,   adder's sense
 critic   flatterer stopped are.
mark    neglect   dispense:
   strongly   purpose bred
   world  methinks  dead.
