sonnet cxxiisonnet cxxiithy gift, thy tables,    brain
full character'd  lasting memory,
    idle rank remain
  date,   eternity;
   least,  long  brain  heart
 faculty  nature  subsist;
   razed oblivion yield  part
 thee, thy record    miss'd.
 poor retention     hold,
   tallies thy dear love  score;
  give      bold,
 trust  tables  receive thee more:
   adjunct  remember thee
  import forgetfulness  me.
