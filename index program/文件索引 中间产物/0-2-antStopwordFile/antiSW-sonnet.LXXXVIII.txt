sonnet lxxxviiisonnet lxxxviiiwhen thou shalt  disposed  set  light,
 place  merit   eye  scorn,
 thy side    fight,
 prove thee virtuous,  thou art forsworn.
   weakness   acquainted,
 thy part   set  a story
 faults conceal'd,    attainted,
 thou  losing  shalt win  glory:
      a gainer too;
 bending   loving thoughts  thee,
 injuries     do,
 thee vantage, double-vantage me.
   love,  thee   belong,
  thy    bear  wrong.
