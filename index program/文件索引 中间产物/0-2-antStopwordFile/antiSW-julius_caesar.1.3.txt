 thunder  lightning. enter   sides, casca,   sword drawn,  cicero  cicero  good even, casca: brought  caesar home? 
    breathless?   stare  so? 
 casca     moved,    sway  earth 
 shakes  a  unfirm? o cicero, 
    tempests,   scolding winds 
  rived  knotty oaks,     
  ambitious ocean swell  rage  foam, 
   exalted   threatening clouds: 
    to-night,   now, 
     a tempest dropping fire. 
    a civil strife  heaven, 
    world,  saucy   gods, 
 incenses   send destruction. 
 cicero  why,      wonderful? 
 casca  a common slave--you     sight-- 
 held   left hand,   flame  burn 
  twenty torches join'd,    hand, 
    fire, remain'd unscorch'd. 
 besides--i ha'   put   sword-- 
   capitol  met a lion, 
  glared  me,   surly by, 
  annoying me:    drawn 
  a heap a  ghastly women, 
 transformed   fear;  swore   
 men   fire walk     streets. 
  yesterday  bird  night  sit 
   noon-day   market-place, 
 hooting  shrieking.   prodigies 
   conjointly meet,   men  
 '   reasons;   natural;' 
 for,  believe,   portentous  
   climate   point upon. 
 cicero  indeed,   a strange-disposed time: 
  men  construe    fashion, 
 clean   purpose    themselves. 
  caesar   capitol to-morrow? 
 casca   doth;    bid antonius 
 send word       to-morrow. 
 cicero  good night then, casca:  disturbed sky 
    walk in. 
 casca  farewell, cicero. 

 exit cicero 
 enter cassius  cassius   there? 
 casca  a roman. 
 cassius  casca,   voice. 
 casca   ear  good. cassius,  night  this! 
 cassius  a  pleasing night  honest men. 
 casca    knew  heavens menace so? 
 cassius       earth  full  faults. 
   part,   walk'd   streets, 
 submitting    perilous night, 
 and,  unbraced, casca,   see, 
  bared  bosom   thunder-stone; 
    cross blue lightning seem'd  open 
  breast  heaven,   present  
    aim   flash  it. 
 casca   wherefore     tempt  heavens? 
    part  men  fear  tremble, 
    mighty gods  tokens send 
  dreadful heralds  astonish us. 
 cassius    dull, casca,   sparks  life 
     a roman   want, 
     not.   pale  gaze 
  put  fear  cast   wonder, 
    strange impatience   heavens: 
       true  
    fires,    gliding ghosts, 
  birds  beasts  quality  kind, 
   men fool  children calculate, 
     change   ordinance 
  natures  preformed faculties 
  monstrous quality,--why,   find 
  heaven hath infused    spirits, 
    instruments  fear  warning 
   monstrous state. 
   i, casca,   thee a  
    dreadful night, 
  thunders, lightens, opens graves,  roars 
  doth  lion   capitol, 
 a   mightier  thyself   
  personal action,  prodigious grown 
  fearful,   strange eruptions are. 
 casca  'tis caesar   mean;   not, cassius? 
 cassius       is:  romans  
  thews  limbs    ancestors; 
 but, woe  while!  fathers' minds  dead, 
    govern'd   mothers' spirits; 
  yoke  sufferance show  womanish. 
 casca  indeed,    senators tomorrow 
   establish caesar  a king; 
    wear  crown  sea  land, 
   place, save   italy. 
 cassius       wear  dagger then; 
 cassius  bondage  deliver cassius: 
 therein, ye gods,    weak  strong; 
 therein, ye gods,  tyrants  defeat: 
  stony tower,  walls  beaten brass, 
  airless dungeon,  strong links  iron, 
   retentive   strength  spirit; 
  life,  weary   worldly bars, 
  lacks power  dismiss itself. 
    this,    world besides, 
  part  tyranny    bear 
   shake   pleasure. 

 thunder   casca    i: 
   bondman    hand bears 
  power  cancel  captivity. 
 cassius     caesar  a tyrant then? 
 poor man!       a wolf, 
    sees  romans   sheep: 
    lion,   romans hinds. 
    haste   a mighty fire 
    weak straws:  trash  rome, 
  rubbish   offal,   serves 
   base matter  illuminate 
  vile a   caesar! but, o grief, 
  hast thou led me?   speak  
  a  bondman;    
  answer   made.    arm'd, 
  dangers    indifferent. 
 casca   speak  casca,    a  
    fleering tell-tale. hold,  hand: 
  factious  redress    griefs, 
    set  foot     
    farthest. 
 cassius   a bargain made. 
   you, casca,   moved  
     noblest-minded romans 
  undergo    enterprise 
  honourable-dangerous consequence; 
    know,  this,  stay   
  pompey's porch:  now,  fearful night, 
    stir  walking   streets; 
   complexion   element 
  favour's   work    hand, 
  bloody, fiery,   terrible. 
 casca  stand close awhile,      haste. 
 cassius  'tis cinna;       gait; 
   a friend. 

 enter cinna  cinna,  haste  so? 
 cinna   find  you.  that? metellus cimber? 
 cassius  no,   casca;  incorporate 
   attempts.    stay'd for, cinna? 
 cinna    glad  't.  a fearful night  this! 
         strange sights. 
 cassius     stay'd for?  me. 
 cinna  yes,  are. 
 o cassius,    
  win  noble brutus   party-- 
 cassius    content: good cinna,   paper, 
    lay    praetor's chair, 
  brutus   find it;  throw  
    window; set    wax 
   brutus' statue:   done, 
 repair  pompey's porch,    find us. 
  decius brutus  trebonius there? 
 cinna    metellus cimber;    
  seek    house. well,   hie, 
   bestow  papers   bade me. 
 cassius   done, repair  pompey's theatre. 

 exit cinna  come, casca,      ere day 
  brutus   house:  parts   
   already,    entire 
    encounter yields  ours. 
 casca  o,  sits high    people's hearts: 
      offence  us, 
  countenance,  richest alchemy, 
  change  virtue   worthiness. 
 cassius     worth   great    
     conceited.   go, 
     midnight;  ere day
