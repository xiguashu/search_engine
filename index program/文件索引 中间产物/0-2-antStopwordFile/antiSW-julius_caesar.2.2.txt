 fierce fiery warriors fought   clouds, 
  ranks  squadrons   form  war, 
  drizzled blood   capitol; 
  noise  battle hurtled   air, 
 horses  neigh,  dying men  groan, 
  ghosts  shriek  squeal   streets.

   love you,     know: 
 calpurnia here,  wife, stays   home: 
  dreamt to-night    statua, 
 which,  a fountain    spouts, 
  run pure blood:   lusty romans 
  smiling,   bathe  hands  it: 
     apply  warnings,  portents, 
  evils imminent;    knee 
 hath begg'd    stay  home to-day. 
 decius brutus   dream   amiss interpreted; 
   a vision fair  fortunate:

     smiling romans bathed, 
 signifies    great rome  suck
