    |      ii.  french camp. 
 enter  dauphin, orleans, rambures,    orleans   sun doth gild  armour; up,  lords! 
 dauphin  montez a cheval!  horse! varlet! laquais! ha! 
 orleans  o brave spirit! 
 dauphin  via! les eaux  la terre. 
 orleans  rien puis? l'air  la feu. 
 dauphin  ciel, cousin orleans. 

 enter constable  now,  lord constable! 
 constable  hark,   steeds  present service neigh! 
 dauphin  mount them,   incision   hides, 
   hot blood  spin  english eyes, 
  dout   superfluous courage, ha! 
 rambures  what,     weep  horses' blood? 
   we, then, behold  natural tears? 

 enter messenger  messenger   english  embattled,  french peers. 
 constable   horse,  gallant princes! straight  horse! 
   behold yon poor  starved band, 
   fair show  suck   souls, 
 leaving    shales  husks  men. 
    work     hands; 
 scarce blood     sickly veins 
  give  naked curtle-axe a stain, 
   french gallants  to-day draw out, 
  sheathe  lack  sport:    blow  them, 
  vapour   valour  o'erturn them. 
 'tis positive 'gainst  exceptions, lords, 
   superfluous lackeys   peasants, 
   unnecessary action swarm 
   squares  battle,  enow 
  purge  field   a hilding foe, 
     mountain's basis  
  stand  idle speculation: 
    honours  not.   say? 
 a      do. 
    done.    trumpets sound 
  tucket sonance   note  mount; 
   approach      field 
  england  couch   fear  yield. 

 enter grandpre  grandpre     stay  long,  lords  france? 
 yon island carrions, desperate   bones, 
 ill-favouredly   morning field: 
  ragged curtains poorly   loose, 
   air shakes  passing scornfully: 
 big mars  bankrupt   beggar'd host 
  faintly  a rusty beaver peeps: 
  horsemen sit  fixed candlesticks, 
  torch-staves   hand;   poor jades 
 lob   heads, dropping  hides  hips, 
  gum down-roping   pale-dead eyes 
    pale dull mouths  gimmal bit 
 lies foul  chew'd grass,   motionless; 
   executors,  knavish crows, 
 fly o'er them,  impatient   hour. 
 description  suit   words 
  demonstrate  life   a battle 
  life  lifeless   shows itself. 
 constable      prayers,   stay  death. 
 dauphin     send  dinners  fresh suits 
  give  fasting horses provender, 
   fight  them? 
 constable   stay    guidon:   field! 
    banner  a trumpet take, 
      haste. come, come, away! 
  sun  high,   outwear  day.
