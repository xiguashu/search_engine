 clarence  o,   pass'd a miserable night, 
  full  ugly sights,  ghastly dreams, 
 that,    a christian faithful man, 
    spend   a night, 
  'twere  buy a world  happy days, 
  full  dismal terror   time! 
 brakenbury     dream?  long  hear   it. 
 clarence  methoughts    broken   tower, 
   embark'd  cross  burgundy; 
 and,   company,  brother gloucester; 
    cabin tempted   walk 
   hatches:   looked  england, 
  cited  a thousand fearful times, 
   wars  york  lancaster 
   befall'n us.   paced  
   giddy footing   hatches, 
 methought  gloucester stumbled; and,  falling, 
 struck me,  thought  stay him, overboard, 
   tumbling billows   main. 
 lord, lord! methought,  pain    drown! 
  dreadful noise  waters   ears! 
  ugly sights  death   eyes! 
 methought   a thousand fearful wrecks; 
 ten thousand men  fishes gnaw'd upon; 
 wedges  gold, great anchors, heaps  pearl, 
 inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, 
  scatter'd   bottom   sea: 
  lay  dead men's skulls; and,   holes 
  eyes   inhabit,   crept, 
  'twere  scorn  eyes, reflecting gems, 
  woo'd  slimy bottom   deep, 
  mock'd  dead bones  lay scatter'd by.

 clarence  o, no,  dream  lengthen'd  life; 
 o,  began  tempest   soul, 
  pass'd, methought,  melancholy flood, 
   grim ferryman  poets write of, 
   kingdom  perpetual night. 
      greet  stranger soul, 
   great father-in-law, renowned warwick; 
  cried aloud, ' scourge  perjury 
   dark monarchy afford false clarence?' 
    vanish'd:   wandering  
 a shadow   angel,  bright hair 
 dabbled  blood;   squeak'd  aloud, 
 'clarence  come; false, fleeting, perjured clarence, 
  stabb'd    field  tewksbury; 
 seize  him, furies,     torments!' 
  that, methoughts, a legion  foul fiends 
 environ'd  about,  howled   ears 
  hideous cries,     noise

         hell, 
  terrible impression   dream.
