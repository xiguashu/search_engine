    |      ii. tyre. a room   palace. 
 enter pericles  pericles  [ lords without]    disturb us.--why  
  change  thoughts, 
  sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy, 
     a guest    hour, 
   day's glorious walk,  peaceful night, 
  tomb  grief  sleep,  breed  quiet? 
  pleasures court  eyes,   eyes shun them, 
  danger,   fear'd,   antioch, 
  aim    short  hit  here: 
   pleasure's art  joy  spirits, 
    other's distance comfort me. 
    thus:  passions   mind, 
     conception  mis-dread, 
  after-nourishment  life  care; 
      fear    done, 
 grows elder   cares    done. 
    me:  great antiochus, 
 'gainst       contend, 
    great      act, 
    speaking,   swear  silence; 
  boots      honour him. 
   suspect   dishonour him: 
      blush   known, 
  stop        known; 
  hostile forces  o'erspread  land, 
    ostent  war    huge, 
 amazement  drive courage   state; 
  men  vanquish'd ere   resist, 
  subjects punish'd  ne'er thought offence: 
  care  them,  pity  myself, 
        tops  trees, 
  fence  roots  grow   defend them, 
    body pine  soul  languish, 
  punish      punish. 

 enter helicanus,   lords   lord  joy   comfort   sacred breast! 
  lord     mind,   return  us, 
 peaceful  comfortable! 
 helicanus  peace, peace,  give experience tongue. 
   abuse  king  flatter him: 
  flattery   bellows blows  sin; 
     flatter'd,  a spark, 
    blast  heat  stronger glowing; 
  reproof, obedient   order, 
 fits kings,    men,    err. 
  signior sooth   proclaim a peace, 
  flatters you,  war   life. 
 prince, pardon me,  strike me,   please; 
        knees. 
 pericles   leave  else;    cares o'erlook 
  shipping   lading's   haven, 
   return  us. 

 exeunt lords  helicanus, thou 
 hast moved us:  seest thou   looks? 
 helicanus   angry brow, dread lord. 
 pericles      a dart  princes' frowns, 
  durst thy tongue move anger   face? 
 helicanus     plants    heaven,   
    nourishment? 
 pericles  thou know'st   power 
   thy life  thee. 
 helicanus  [kneeling] 
   ground  axe myself; 
    strike  blow. 
 pericles  rise, prithee, rise. 
 sit down: thou art  flatterer: 
   thee  it;  heaven forbid 
  kings    ears hear  
 faults hid! 
 fit counsellor  servant  a prince, 
   thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant, 
  wouldst thou   do? 
 helicanus   bear  patience 
  griefs     lay  yourself. 
 pericles  thou speak'st  a physician, helicanus, 
  minister'st a potion   
  thou wouldst tremble  receive thyself. 
 attend me, then:    antioch, 
   thou know'st,   face  death, 
  sought  purchase  a glorious beauty. 
    issue   propagate, 
  arms  princes,  bring joys  subjects. 
  face    eye   wonder; 
  rest--hark  thine ear--as black  incest: 
    knowledge found,  sinful father 
 seem'd   strike,  smooth:  thou 
 know'st this, 
 'tis time  fear  tyrants   kiss. 
  fear  grew  me,   fled, 
   covering  a careful night, 
  seem'd  good protector; and,  here, 
 bethought    past,   succeed. 
  knew  tyrannous;  tyrants' fears 
 decrease not,  grow faster   years: 
    doubt it,   doubt  doth, 
    open   listening air 
   worthy princes' bloods  shed, 
    bed  blackness unlaid ope, 
  lop  doubt,  fill  land  arms, 
   pretence  wrong     him: 
  all,  mine,    call offence, 
  feel war's blow,  spares  innocence: 
  love  all,   thyself art one, 
   reprovest   it,-- 
 helicanus  alas, sir! 
 pericles  drew sleep    eyes, blood   cheeks, 
 musings   mind,  thousand doubts 
    stop  tempest ere  came; 
  finding  comfort  relieve them, 
  thought  princely charity  grieve them. 
 helicanus  well,  lord,      leave  speak. 
 freely   speak. antiochus  fear, 
  justly too,  think,  fear  tyrant, 
    public war  private treason 
     life. 
 therefore,  lord,  travel  a while, 
    rage  anger  forgot, 
    destinies  cut  thread  life. 
  rule direct  any;   me. 
 day serves  light  faithful   be. 
 pericles     doubt thy faith; 
    wrong  liberties   absence? 
 helicanus   mingle  bloods    earth, 
         birth. 
 pericles  tyre,     thee then,   tarsus 
 intend  travel,   hear  thee; 
    letters  dispose myself. 
  care      subjects' good 
  thee  lay  wisdom's strength  bear it. 
   thy word  faith,   thine oath: 
  shuns   break    crack both: 
    orbs  live    safe, 
  time    truth  ne'er convince, 
 thou show'dst a subject's shine,  a true prince.
