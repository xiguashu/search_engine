sonnet lviisonnet lviibeing  slave,      tend
  hours  times   desire?
   precious time    spend,
 services  do,   require.
   chide  world-without-end hour
 i,  sovereign, watch  clock  you,
   bitterness  absence sour
   bid  servant  adieu;
   question   jealous thought
   be,   affairs suppose,
but,  a sad slave, stay    nought
save,     happy   those.
 true a fool  love    will,
    thing,  thinks  ill.
