sonnet xxxvisonnet xxxvilet  confess      twain,
  undivided loves  one:
   blots     remain
 thy     borne alone.
   loves     respect,
   lives a separable spite,
   alter  love's sole effect,
 doth  steal sweet hours  love's delight.
    acknowledge thee,
  bewailed guilt   thee shame,
 thou  public kindness honour me,
 thou   honour  thy name:
   so;  love thee   sort
as, thou  mine,   thy good report.
