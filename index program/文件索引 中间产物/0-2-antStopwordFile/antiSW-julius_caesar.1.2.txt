 antony  fear  not, caesar;   dangerous; 
   a noble roman   given. 
 caesar     fatter!   fear  not: 
      liable  fear, 
         avoid

 brutus       casca   chanced. 
 casca  why,   a crown offered him:   
 offered him,  put        hand, 
 thus;    people fell a-shouting.

 casca  why,   too. 
 cassius   shouted thrice:     cry for? 
 casca  why,   too.

 casca   fell    market-place,  foamed  
 mouth,   speechless. 
 brutus  'tis  like:  hath  failing sickness. 
 cassius  no, caesar hath  not;    i, 
  honest casca,    falling sickness. 
 casca         that; but,   sure, 
 caesar fell down.   tag-rag people

 caesar doth bear  hard;   loves brutus:

       citizens, 
 writings  tending   great opinion
