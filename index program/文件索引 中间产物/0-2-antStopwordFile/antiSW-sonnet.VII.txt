sonnet viisonnet viilo!   orient   gracious light
lifts   burning head,   eye
doth homage   new-appearing sight,
serving    sacred majesty;
  climb'd  steep-up heavenly hill,
resembling strong youth   middle age,
 mortal  adore  beauty still,
attending   golden pilgrimage;
   highmost pitch,  weary car,
 feeble age,  reeleth   day,
 eyes, 'fore duteous,  converted 
   tract    way:
 thou, thyself out-going  thy noon,
unlook'd  diest,  thou  a son.
