sonnet xxvisonnet xxvilord   love,    vassalage
thy merit hath  duty strongly knit,
 thee  send  written embassage,
 witness duty,   show  wit:
duty  great,  wit  poor  
   bare,  wanting words  show it,
   hope  good conceit  thine
 thy soul's thought,  naked,  bestow it;
 whatsoever star  guides  moving
points   graciously  fair aspect
 puts apparel   tatter'd loving,
 show  worthy  thy sweet respect:
     boast    love thee;
   show  head  thou mayst prove me.
