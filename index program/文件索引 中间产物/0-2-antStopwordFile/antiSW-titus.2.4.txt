   thy love?  dost  speak  me? 
 alas, a crimson river  warm blood, 
   a bubbling fountain stirr'd  wind, 
 doth rise  fall  thy rosed lips, 
 coming    thy honey breath. 
 but, sure,  tereus hath deflowered thee, 
 and,  thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue. 
 ah,  thou turn'st  thy face  shame! 
 and,    loss  blood, 
   a conduit   issuing spouts,

 come,   go,   thy father blind; 
   a sight  blind a father's eye: 
  hour's storm  drown  fragrant meads; 
    months  tears thy father's eyes? 
   draw back,    mourn  thee 
 o,   mourning ease thy misery!
