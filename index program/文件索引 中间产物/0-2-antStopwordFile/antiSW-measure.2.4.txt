 enter angelo  angelo     pray  think,    pray 
   subjects. heaven hath  empty words; 
   invention, hearing   tongue, 
 anchors  isabel: heaven   mouth, 
       chew  name; 
    heart  strong  swelling evil 
   conception.  state, whereon  studied 
   a good thing,   read, 
 grown fear'd  tedious; yea,  gravity, 
 wherein--let   hear me--i  pride, 
    boot change   idle plume, 
   air beats  vain. o place, o form, 
   dost thou  thy case, thy habit, 
 wrench awe  fools  tie  wiser souls 
  thy false seeming! blood, thou art blood: 
  write good angel   devil's horn: 
 'tis   devil's crest. 

 enter a servant   now!  there? 
 servant   isabel, a sister, desires access  you. 
 angelo  teach   way. 

 exit servant  o heavens! 
    blood  muster   heart, 
 making   unable  itself, 
  dispossessing    parts 
   fitness? 
  play  foolish throngs    swoons; 
     him,   stop  air 
     revive:    
  general, subject  a well-wish'd king, 
 quit   part,   obsequious fondness 
 crowd   presence,   untaught love 
    offence. 

 enter isabella   now, fair maid? 
 isabella        pleasure. 
 angelo      it,      
   demand  'tis.  brother  live. 
 isabella   so. heaven   honour! 
 angelo     live awhile; and,   be, 
  long         die. 
 isabella    sentence? 
 angelo  yea. 
 isabella  when,  beseech you?    reprieve, 
 longer  shorter,     fitted 
   soul sicken not. 
 angelo  ha! fie,  filthy vices!    good 
  pardon   hath  nature stolen 
 a   made,   remit 
  saucy sweetness   coin heaven's image 
  stamps   forbid: 'tis   easy 
 falsely    a life true  
   put metal  restrained means 
   a false one. 
 isabella  'tis set    heaven,    earth. 
 angelo    so?    pose  quickly. 
    rather,     law 
    brother's life; or,  redeem him, 
 give   body   sweet uncleanness 
     hath stain'd? 
 isabella  sir,  this, 
    give  body   soul. 
 angelo   talk    soul:  compell'd sins 
 stand   number   accompt. 
 isabella    you? 
 angelo  nay,   warrant that;    speak 
     say. answer  this: 
 i,   voice   recorded law, 
 pronounce a sentence   brother's life: 
     a charity  sin 
  save  brother's life? 
 isabella     do't, 
     a peril   soul, 
    sin  all,  charity. 
 angelo  pleased   do't  peril   soul, 
  equal poise  sin  charity. 
 isabella     beg  life,    sin, 
 heaven   bear it!  granting   suit, 
    sin,     morn prayer 
    added   faults  mine, 
     answer. 
 angelo  nay,  hear me. 
  sense pursues  mine:    ignorant, 
    craftily;    good. 
 isabella     ignorant,    good, 
  graciously      better. 
 angelo   wisdom wishes    bright 
   doth tax itself;   black masks 
 proclaim  enshield beauty ten times louder 
  beauty could, display'd.  mark me; 
   received plain,  speak  gross: 
  brother   die. 
 isabella  so. 
 angelo    offence  so,   appears, 
 accountant   law   pain. 
 isabella  true. 
 angelo  admit     save  life,-- 
   subscribe  that,   other, 
    loss  question,--that you,  sister, 
 finding  desired   a person, 
  credit   judge,   great place, 
  fetch  brother   manacles 
   all-building law;     
  earthly   save him,    
   lay   treasures   body 
   supposed,      suffer; 
    do? 
 isabella      poor brother  myself: 
  is,     terms  death, 
  impression  keen whips i'ld wear  rubies, 
  strip   death,   a bed 
  longing   sick for, ere i'ld yield 
  body   shame. 
 angelo     brother die. 
 isabella   'twere  cheaper way: 
    a brother died  once, 
   a sister,  redeeming him, 
  die  ever. 
 angelo       cruel   sentence 
    slander'd so? 
 isabella  ignomy  ransom  free pardon 
    houses: lawful mercy 
   kin  foul redemption. 
 angelo   seem'd  late    law a tyrant; 
   proved  sliding   brother 
 a merriment  a vice. 
 isabella  o, pardon me,  lord;  oft falls out, 
      have,  speak    mean: 
    excuse    hate, 
   advantage   dearly love. 
 angelo     frail. 
 isabella     brother die, 
   a feodary,    
 owe  succeed thy weakness. 
 angelo  nay, women  frail too. 
 isabella  ay,   glasses   view themselves; 
    easy broke    forms. 
 women!  heaven! men  creation mar 
  profiting  them. nay, call  ten times frail; 
    soft   complexions are, 
  credulous  false prints. 
 angelo     well: 
    testimony    sex,-- 
   suppose       stronger 
  faults  shake  frames,--let   bold; 
   arrest  words.    are, 
  is, a woman;    more,  none; 
    one,     express'd 
   external warrants, show  now, 
  putting   destined livery. 
 isabella     tongue  one: gentle  lord, 
   entreat  speak   language. 
 angelo  plainly conceive,  love you. 
 isabella   brother  love juliet, 
        die  it. 
 angelo    not, isabel,   give  love. 
 isabella     virtue hath a licence in't, 
   a  fouler   is, 
  pluck  others. 
 angelo   me,   honour, 
  words express  purpose. 
 isabella  ha!  honour    believed, 
   pernicious purpose! seeming, seeming! 
   proclaim thee, angelo;  for't: 
 sign  a present pardon   brother, 
    outstretch'd throat    world aloud 
   thou art. 
 angelo     thee, isabel? 
  unsoil'd name,  austereness   life, 
  vouch  you,   place i'  state, 
    accusation overweigh, 
    stifle    report 
  smell  calumny.   begun, 
    give  sensual race  rein: 
 fit thy consent   sharp appetite; 
 lay   nicety  prolixious blushes, 
  banish   sue for; redeem thy brother 
  yielding  thy body   will; 
       die  death, 
  thy unkindness   death draw  
  lingering sufferance. answer  to-morrow, 
 or,   affection   guides  most, 
  prove a tyrant  him.   you, 
    can,  false o'erweighs  true. 

 exit  isabella      complain?    this, 
    me? o perilous mouths, 
  bear      self-same tongue, 
   condemnation  approof; 
 bidding  law  court'sy   will: 
 hooking    wrong   appetite, 
  follow   draws!    brother: 
   hath fallen  prompture   blood, 
  hath     a mind  honour. 
 that,   twenty heads  tender  
  twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield  up, 
   sister   body stoop 
   abhorr'd pollution. 
 then, isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die: 
    brother   chastity. 
      angelo's request, 
  fit  mind  death,   soul's rest.
