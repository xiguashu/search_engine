sonnet xvsonnet xvwhen      grows
holds  perfection  a  moment,
  huge stage presenteth nought  shows
whereon  stars  secret influence comment;
  perceive  men  plants increase,
cheered  cheque'd    self-same sky,
vaunt   youthful sap,  height decrease,
 wear  brave state   memory;
  conceit   inconstant stay
sets   rich  youth   sight,
 wasteful time debateth  decay,
 change  day  youth  sullied night;
   war  time  love  you,
  takes  you,  engraft  new.
