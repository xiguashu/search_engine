    |      i. troy.  priam's palace. 
 enter troilus armed,  pandarus  troilus  call   varlet;  unarm again: 
    war   walls  troy, 
  find  cruel battle  within? 
  trojan   master   heart, 
    field; troilus, alas! hath none. 
 pandarus    gear ne'er  mended? 
 troilus   greeks  strong  skilful   strength, 
 fierce   skill    fierceness valiant; 
    weaker  a woman's tear, 
 tamer  sleep, fonder  ignorance, 
  valiant   virgin   night 
  skilless  unpractised infancy. 
 pandarus  well,   told    this:   part, 
   meddle    further.    
  a cake    wheat   tarry  grinding. 
 troilus     tarried? 
 pandarus  ay,  grinding;    tarry 
  bolting. 
 troilus     tarried? 
 pandarus  ay,  bolting,    tarry  leavening. 
 troilus     tarried. 
 pandarus  ay,   leavening;      word 
 'hereafter'  kneading,  making   cake,  
 heating   oven   baking; nay,   
 stay  cooling too,    chance  burn  lips. 
 troilus  patience herself,  goddess e'er  be, 
 doth lesser blench  sufferance   do. 
  priam's royal table   sit; 
   fair cressid    thoughts,-- 
 so, traitor! '  comes!'    thence? 
 pandarus  well,  looked yesternight fairer     
  look,   woman else. 
 troilus       thee:--when  heart, 
  wedged  a sigh,  rive  twain, 
  hector   father  perceive me, 
  have,    sun doth light a storm, 
 buried  sigh  wrinkle  a smile: 
  sorrow,   couch'd   gladness, 
    mirth fate turns  sudden sadness. 
 pandarus    hair    darker  helen's-- 
 well,  to--there    comparison  
  women: but,   part,    kinswoman;  
  not,   term it, praise her:    
   heard  talk yesterday,   did.  
   dispraise  sister cassandra's wit, but-- 
 troilus  o pandarus!   thee, pandarus,-- 
     thee,   hopes lie drown'd, 
 reply     fathoms deep 
  lie indrench'd.   thee   mad 
  cressid's love: thou answer'st '  fair;' 
 pour'st   open ulcer   heart 
  eyes,  hair,  cheek,  gait,  voice, 
 handlest  thy discourse, o,   hand, 
   comparison  whites  ink, 
 writing   reproach,   soft seizure 
  cygnet's   harsh  spirit  sense 
 hard   palm  ploughman:  thou tell'st me, 
  true thou tell'st me,     love her; 
 but,  thus,   oil  balm, 
 thou lay'st   gash  love hath   
  knife   it. 
 pandarus   speak    truth. 
 troilus  thou dost  speak  much. 
 pandarus  faith,   meddle in't.      is: 
    fair, 'tis    her;    
 not,    mends    hands. 
 troilus  good pandarus,  now, pandarus! 
 pandarus      labour   travail; ill-thought   
   ill-thought   you;    
 between,  small    labour. 
 troilus  what, art thou angry, pandarus? what,  me? 
 pandarus    kin  me,     fair 
  helen:     kin  me,     
 fair  friday  helen   sunday.   care 
 i?  care     a black-a-moor; 'tis    me. 
 troilus       fair? 
 pandarus     care     no.  a fool  
 stay   father;     greeks;   
      time   her:   part, 
  meddle     i'  matter. 
 troilus  pandarus,-- 
 pandarus   i. 
 troilus  sweet pandarus,-- 
 pandarus  pray you, speak    me:   leave    
  it,    end. 

 exit pandarus.  alarum  troilus  peace,  ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds! 
 fools   sides! helen    fair, 
    blood  daily paint  thus. 
   fight   argument; 
    starved a subject   sword. 
  pandarus,--o gods,    plague me! 
     cressid   pandar; 
    tetchy   woo'd  woo. 
    stubborn-chaste   suit. 
  me, apollo,  thy daphne's love, 
  cressid is,  pandar,   we? 
  bed  india;   lies, a pearl: 
   ilium    resides, 
    call'd  wild  wandering flood, 
 ourself  merchant,   sailing pandar 
  doubtful hope,  convoy   bark. 

 alarum. enter aeneas  aeneas   now, prince troilus! wherefore  afield? 
 troilus    there:  woman's answer sorts, 
  womanish      thence. 
  news, aeneas,   field to-day? 
 aeneas   paris  returned home  hurt. 
 troilus   whom, aeneas? 
 aeneas  troilus,  menelaus. 
 troilus   paris bleed; 'tis  a scar  scorn; 
 paris  gored  menelaus' horn.
