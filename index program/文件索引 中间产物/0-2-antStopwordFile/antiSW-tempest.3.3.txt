   bones ache:  a maze trod  
  forth-rights  meanders!   patience, 
    rest me. 
 alonso   lord,   blame thee, 
    attach'd  weariness, 
   dulling   spirits: sit down,  rest. 
     put   hope    
  longer   flatterer:   drown'd 
    stray  find,   sea mocks 
  frustrate search  land. well,   go.

 solemn  strange music  alonso   harmony  this?  good friends, hark! 
 gonzalo  marvellous sweet music! 

 enter prospero above, invisible. enter   strange shapes, bringing  a banquet;   dance    gentle actions   salutation; and, inviting  king,  & c.  eat,  depart  alonso  give  kind keepers, heavens!   these? 
 sebastian  a living drollery.     
    unicorns,   arabia 
    tree,  phoenix' throne,  phoenix 
   hour reigning there. 
 antonio    both; 
      credit,   me, 
    sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er  
 lie, 
  fools  home condemn 'em. 
 gonzalo    naples 
   report  now,    me? 
    say,    islanders-- 
 for, certes,   people   island-- 
 who,     monstrous shape, yet, note, 
  manners   gentle-kind   
  human generation   find 
 many, nay,  any. 
 prospero  [aside]              honest lord, 
 thou hast  well;      present 
  worse  devils. 
 alonso      muse 
  shapes,  gesture   sound, expressing, 
       tongue, a kind 
  excellent dumb discourse. 
 prospero  [aside]	praise  departing. 
 francisco   vanish'd strangely. 
 sebastian   matter,  
   left  viands behind;    stomachs. 
 will't   taste    here? 
 alonso   i. 
 gonzalo  faith, sir,    fear.    boys, 
       mountaineers 
 dew-lapp'd  bulls,  throats  hanging  'em 
 wallets  flesh?      men

 stand     we. 

 thunder  lightning. enter ariel,  a  harpy; claps  wings   table; and,  a quaint device,  banquet vanishes  ariel     men  sin,  destiny, 
  hath  instrument   world 
    in't,  never-surfeited sea 
 hath caused  belch  you;    island 
   doth  inhabit;  'mongst men 
   unfit  live.     mad; 
    such-like valour men hang  drown 
  proper selves. 

 alonso, sebastian  & c. draw  swords   fools!    fellows 
  ministers  fate:  elements, 
    swords  temper'd,    
 wound  loud winds,   bemock'd-at stabs 
 kill  still-closing waters,  diminish 
  dowle    plume:  fellow-ministers 
   invulnerable.    hurt, 
  swords    massy   strengths 
     uplifted.  remember-- 
    business  you--that   
  milan  supplant good prospero; 
 exposed   sea,  hath requit it, 
    innocent child:   foul deed 
  powers, delaying,  forgetting,  
 incensed  seas  shores, yea,   creatures, 
   peace. thee  thy son, alonso, 
   bereft;   pronounce  me: 
 lingering perdition, worse   death 
    once,  step  step attend 
    ways;  wraths  guard  from-- 
  here,    desolate isle,  falls 
   heads--is   heart-sorrow 
  a clear life ensuing. 

  vanishes  thunder; then,  soft music  enter  shapes again,  dance,  mocks  mows,  carrying   table  prospero  bravely  figure   harpy hast thou 
 perform'd,  ariel; a grace  had, devouring: 
   instruction hast thou  bated 
   thou hadst  say: so,  good life 
  observation strange,  meaner ministers 
   kinds  done.  high charms work 
    enemies   knit  
   distractions;      power; 
    fits  leave them,   visit 
 young ferdinand,   suppose  drown'd, 
     loved darling. 

 exit   gonzalo  i'     holy, sir,  stand  
   strange stare? 
 alonso  o,   monstrous, monstrous: 
 methought  billows spoke  told   it; 
  winds  sing   me,   thunder, 
  deep  dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced 
    prosper:   bass  trespass. 
   son i'  ooze  bedded,  
  seek  deeper  e'er plummet sounded 
     lie mudded. 

 exit  sebastian    fiend  a time, 
  fight  legions o'er. 
 antonio    thy second. 

 exeunt sebastian,  antonio  gonzalo       desperate:  great guilt, 
  poison   work a great time after, 
  'gins  bite  spirits.   beseech
