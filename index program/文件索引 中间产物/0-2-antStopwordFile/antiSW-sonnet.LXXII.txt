 merit lived  me,    love
  death, dear love, forget  quite,
      worthy prove;
   devise  virtuous lie,

 niggard truth  willingly impart:
o,   true love   false  this,
   love speak    untrue,
   buried   body is,
 live    shame    you.
   shamed     bring forth,
   you,  love   worth.
