 re-enter hastings  hastings   lord,  army  dispersed already; 
  youthful steers unyoked,    courses 
 east, west, north, south; or,  a school broke up, 
  hurries   home  sporting-place. 
 westmoreland  good tidings,  lord hastings;    
   arrest thee, traitor,  high treason: 
  you, lord archbishop,  you, lord mowbray,
