 starr'd  unluckily,    breast, 
  innocent milk    innocent mouth,

 thy by-gone fooleries   spices  it. 
  thou betray'dst polixenes,'twas nothing; 
    show thee,  a fool, inconstant 
  damnable ingrateful:  was't much, 
 thou wouldst  poison'd good camillo's honour, 
    kill a king: poor trespasses, 
  monstrous standing by: whereof  reckon 
  casting   crows thy baby-daughter 
      little;  a devil

      gods. but, o thou tyrant! 
   repent  things,    heavier 
   thy woes  stir;  betake thee 
    despair. a thousand knees 
 ten thousand years together, naked, fasting, 
  a barren mountain   winter 
  storm perpetual,   move  gods 
     thou wert. 
 leontes   on,   
 thou canst  speak  much;   deserved 
  tongues  talk  bitterest.

 howe'er  business goes,    fault 
 i'  boldness   speech. 
 paulina     for't: 
  faults  make,       them, 
   repent. alas!   show'd   
  rashness  a woman:   touch'd 
   noble heart.       
    grief:   receive affliction 
   petition;  beseech you,  
    punish'd,   minded

 sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman: 
  love  bore  queen--lo, fool again!-- 
  speak    more,    children; 
   remember     lord, 
   lost too:   patience  you, 
    nothing. 
 leontes  thou didst speak   
    truth;   receive   
    pitied  thee. prithee, bring  
   dead bodies   queen  son: 
  grave    both:    
     death appear,  
  shame perpetual.  a day  visit 
  chapel   lie,  tears shed  
    recreation:  long  nature 
  bear    exercise,  long 
  daily vow   it.   lead  
   sorrows.
