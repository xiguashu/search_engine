    |      i.  forest  arden. 
 enter duke senior, amiens,     lords,  foresters  duke senior  now,  co-mates  brothers  exile, 
 hath   custom   life  sweet 
    painted pomp?    woods 
  free  peril   envious court? 
  feel    penalty  adam, 
  seasons' difference,   icy fang 
  churlish chiding   winter's wind, 
 which,   bites  blows   body, 
    shrink  cold,  smile   
 '   flattery:   counsellors 
  feelingly persuade    am.' 
 sweet     adversity, 
 which,   toad, ugly  venomous, 
 wears  a precious jewel   head; 
    life exempt  public haunt 
 finds tongues  trees, books   running brooks, 
 sermons  stones  good   thing. 
    change it. 
 amiens  happy   grace, 
   translate  stubbornness  fortune 
   quiet   sweet a style. 
 duke senior  come,     kill  venison? 
    irks   poor dappled fools, 
  native burghers   desert city, 
     confines  forked heads 
    haunches gored. 
  lord  indeed,  lord, 
  melancholy jaques grieves  that, 
 and,   kind, swears    usurp 
  doth  brother  hath banish'd you. 
 to-day  lord  amiens   
  steal     lay  
   oak  antique root peeps  
   brook  brawls   wood:

    hunter's aim  ta'en a hurt, 
    languish,  indeed,  lord, 
  wretched animal heaved   groans 
   discharge  stretch  leathern coat 
   bursting,   big  tears 
 coursed     innocent nose 
  piteous chase;    hairy fool 
  marked   melancholy jaques, 
 stood   extremest verge   swift brook, 
 augmenting   tears. 
 duke senior     jaques? 
    moralize  spectacle? 
  lord  o, yes,  a thousand similes. 
 first,   weeping   needless stream; 
 'poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament 
  worldlings do, giving thy sum   
      much:' then,   alone, 
 left  abandon'd   velvet friends, 
 ''tis right:' quoth he; ' misery doth part 
  flux  company:' anon a careless herd, 
 full   pasture, jumps    
   stays  greet him; 'ay' quoth jaques, 
 'sweep on,  fat  greasy citizens; 
 'tis   fashion: wherefore    
   poor  broken bankrupt there?' 
   invectively  pierceth  
  body   country, city, court, 
 yea,     life, swearing   
  mere usurpers, tyrants   worse, 
  fright  animals   kill   
   assign'd  native dwelling-place.

  lord   did,  lord, weeping  commenting 
   sobbing deer. 
 duke senior  show   place: 
  love  cope    sullen fits, 
    full  matter. 
  lord   bring    straight.
