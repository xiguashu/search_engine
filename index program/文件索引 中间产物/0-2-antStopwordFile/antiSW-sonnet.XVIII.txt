sonnet xviiisonnet xviiishall  compare thee  a summer's day?
thou art  lovely   temperate:
rough winds  shake  darling buds  may,
 summer's lease hath   short a date:
  hot  eye  heaven shines,
    gold complexion dimm'd;
  fair  fair  declines,
 chance  nature's changing  untrimm'd;
 thy eternal summer   fade
 lose possession   fair thou owest;
  death brag thou wander'st   shade,
  eternal lines  time thou growest:
 long  men  breathe  eyes  see,
 long lives     life  thee.
