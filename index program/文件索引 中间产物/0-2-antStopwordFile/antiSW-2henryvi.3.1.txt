 thou  didst  wrong,    wrong; 
    butcher takes   calf 
  binds  wretch,  beats    strays, 
 bearing    bloody slaughter-house, 
   remorseless   borne  hence; 
    dam runs lowing   down, 
     harmless young  went, 
    nought  wail  darling's loss, 
    bewails good gloucester's case 
  sad unhelpful tears,   dimm'd eyes 
        good, 
  mighty   vowed enemies. 
  fortunes   weep; and, 'twixt  groan 
  ' a traitor? gloucester   none.'

 henry  lord  cold  great affairs, 
  full  foolish pity,  gloucester's show 
 beguiles    mournful crocodile 
  sorrow snares relenting passengers, 
    snake roll'd  a flowering bank, 
  shining chequer'd slough, doth sting a child 
    beauty thinks  excellent.

  rid    fear    him. 
 cardinal     die  worthy policy; 
     a colour   death: 
 'tis meet   condemn'd    law. 
 suffolk  but,   mind,    policy: 
  king  labour   save  life, 
  commons haply rise,  save  life; 
      trivial argument, 
   mistrust,  shows  worthy death. 
 york   that,  this,      die. 
 suffolk  ah, york,   alive  fain  i! 
 york  'tis york  hath  reason   death. 
 but,  lord cardinal,  you,  lord  suffolk,

 suffolk  madam, 'tis true;  were't  madness, then, 
    fox surveyor   fold? 
   accused a crafty murderer, 
  guilt    idly posted over, 
   purpose   executed. 
 no;   die,     a fox, 
  nature proved  enemy   flock, 
   chaps  stain'd  crimson blood, 
  humphrey, proved  reasons,   liege. 
    stand  quillets   slay him: 
    gins,  snares,  subtlety, 
 sleeping  waking, 'tis  matter how, 
    dead;    good deceit 
  mates     intends deceit. 
 queen margaret  thrice-noble suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke. 
 suffolk   resolute,     done; 
     spoke  seldom meant: 
    heart accordeth   tongue, 
   deed  meritorious, 
   preserve  sovereign   foe, 
    word,      priest. 
 cardinal       dead,  lord  suffolk, 
 ere    due orders  a priest: 
   consent  censure   deed, 
   provide  executioner, 
  tender   safety   liege. 
 suffolk     hand,  deed  worthy doing. 
 queen margaret     i.

 cardinal  a breach  craves a quick expedient stop! 
  counsel give    weighty cause? 
 york   somerset    regent thither: 
 'tis meet  lucky ruler  employ'd; 
 witness  fortune  hath   france. 
 somerset   york,    far-fet policy, 
    regent    me, 
     stay'd  france  long. 
 york  no,   lose  all,  thou hast done: 
     lost  life betimes 
  bring a burthen  dishonour home 
  staying   long    lost. 
 show   scar character'd  thy skin: 
 men's flesh preserved    seldom win. 
 queen margaret  nay, then,  spark  prove a raging fire, 
  wind  fuel  brought  feed  with: 
  more, good york; sweet somerset,  still: 
 thy fortune, york, hadst thou  regent there, 
  happily  proved  worse  his. 
 york  what, worse  nought? nay, then, a shame  all! 
 somerset  and,   number, thee  wishest shame! 
 cardinal   lord  york,    fortune is. 
  uncivil kerns  ireland   arms 
  temper clay  blood  englishmen: 
  ireland   lead a band  men, 
 collected choicely,   county some, 
    hap   irishmen? 
 york   will,  lord,    majesty. 
 suffolk  why,  authority   consent, 
     establish  confirms: 
 then, noble york,  thou  task  hand. 
 york    content: provide  soldiers, lords, 
 whiles   order    affairs. 
 suffolk  a charge, lord york,     perform'd. 
   return    false duke humphrey. 
 cardinal     him;    deal   
  henceforth   trouble   more. 
   break off;  day   spent: 
 lord suffolk,     talk   event. 
 york   lord  suffolk,  fourteen days 
  bristol  expect  soldiers; 
    ship    ireland. 
 suffolk      done,  lord  york. 

 exeunt   york  york  now, york,  never, steel thy fearful thoughts, 
  change misdoubt  resolution: 
   thou hopest  be,   thou art 
 resign  death;    worth  enjoying: 
  pale-faced fear    mean-born man, 
  find  harbour  a royal heart. 
 faster  spring-time showers  thought
