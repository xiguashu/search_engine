sonnet lxxsonnet lxxthat thou art blamed    thy defect,
 slander's mark     fair;
 ornament  beauty  suspect,
a crow  flies  heaven's sweetest air.
 thou  good, slander doth  approve
thy worth  greater,  woo'd  time;
 canker vice  sweetest buds doth love,
 thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
thou hast pass'd   ambush  young days,
  assail'd  victor  charged;
  thy praise    thy praise,
 tie  envy  enlarged:
  suspect  ill mask'd  thy show,
 thou  kingdoms  hearts shouldst owe.
