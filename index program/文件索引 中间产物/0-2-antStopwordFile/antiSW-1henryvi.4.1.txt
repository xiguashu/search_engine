  vow'd, base knight,    meet thee next, 
  tear  garter  thy craven's leg, 

 plucking       done,  unworthily 
 thou wast installed   high degree.

   divers gentlemen  
   surprised   prisoners. 
  judge, great lords,     amiss; 
     cowards   wear 
  ornament  knighthood, yea  no. 
 gloucester     truth,  fact  infamous 
  ill beseeming  common man,

 talbot     order  ordain'd,  lords, 
 knights   garter   noble birth, 
 valiant  virtuous, full  haughty courage,

 gloucester   means  grace,   hath changed  style? 
   but, plain  bluntly, '  king!' 
 hath  forgot    sovereign?

 pretend  alteration  good will? 
  here? 

 reads  ' have,  especial cause, 
 moved  compassion   country's wreck, 
    pitiful complaints 
     oppression feeds upon, 
 forsaken  pernicious faction 
  join'd  charles,  rightful king  france.' 
 o monstrous treachery!    so, 
   alliance, amity  oaths, 
      false dissembling guile? 
 king henry vi  what! doth  uncle burgundy revolt? 
 gloucester   doth,  lord,     foe.

 basset  crossing  sea  england  france, 
  fellow here,  envious carping tongue, 
 upbraided    rose  wear; 
 saying,  sanguine colour   leaves 
  represent  master's blushing cheeks, 
  stubbornly   repugn  truth 
  a  question   law 
 argued betwixt  duke  york  him; 
   vile  ignominious terms: 
  confutation   rude reproach 
   defence   lord's worthiness, 
  crave  benefit  law  arms. 
 vernon      petition, noble lord: 
      forged quaint conceit 
  set a gloss   bold intent, 
  know,  lord,   provoked  him;

 pronouncing   paleness   flower 
 bewray'd  faintness   master's heart. 
 york     malice, somerset,  left? 
 somerset   private grudge,  lord  york,  out, 
  ne'er  cunningly  smother it. 
 king henry vi  good lord,  madness rules  brainsick men, 
    slight  frivolous a  
  factious emulations  arise! 
 good cousins both,  york  somerset, 
 quiet yourselves,  pray,    peace. 
 york    dissension     fight, 
    highness  command a peace. 
 somerset   quarrel toucheth    alone; 
 betwixt    decide  then. 
 york     pledge; accept it, somerset. 
 vernon  nay,   rest   began  first. 
 basset  confirm  so,  honourable lord. 
 gloucester  confirm  so! confounded   strife! 
  perish ye,   audacious prate! 
 presumptuous vassals,    ashamed 
   immodest clamorous outrage 
  trouble  disturb  king  us? 
  you,  lords, methinks     
  bear   perverse objections; 
     occasion   mouths 
  raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves: 
   persuade   a  course. 
 exeter   grieves  highness: good  lords,  friends. 
 king henry vi   hither,     combatants: 
 henceforth  charge you,   love  favour, 
   forget  quarrel   cause. 
  you,  lords, remember   are, 
  france,  a fickle wavering nation: 
   perceive dissension    
      disagree, 
    grudging stomachs  provoked 
  wilful disobedience,  rebel! 
 beside,  infamy   arise, 
  foreign princes   certified 
   a toy, a    regard, 
 king henry's peers  chief nobility 
 destroy'd themselves,  lost  realm  france! 
 o,    conquest   father, 
  tender years,     forego 
   a trifle   bought  blood 
    umpire   doubtful strife. 
    reason,   wear  rose, 

 putting  a red rose        suspicious 
   incline  somerset  york: 
    kinsmen,   love  both: 
     upbraid    crown, 
 because, forsooth,  king  scots  crown'd. 
   discretions   persuade 
      instruct  teach: 
  therefore,      peace, 
     continue peace  love. 
 cousin  york,  institute  grace 
    regent   parts  france: 
 and, good  lord  somerset, unite 
  troops  horsemen   bands  foot; 
 and,  true subjects, sons   progenitors,

 flourish. exeunt   york, warwick, exeter  vernon  warwick   lord  york,  promise you,  king 
 prettily, methought,  play  orator. 
 york     did;      not, 
    wears  badge  somerset. 
 warwick  tush,     fancy, blame  not; 
   presume, sweet prince,  thought  harm. 
 york     wist  did,--but   rest; 
  affairs    managed. 

 exeunt   exeter  exeter   didst thou, richard,  suppress thy voice; 
 for,   passions  thy heart burst out, 
  fear     decipher'd  
  rancorous spite,  furious raging broils, 
     imagined  supposed. 
  howsoe'er,  simple   sees 
  jarring discord  nobility, 
  shouldering      court, 
  factious bandying   favourites, 
    doth presage  ill event. 
 'tis   sceptres   children's hands; 
    envy breeds unkind division; 
    rain,  begins confusion.
