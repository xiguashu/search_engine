  pack  him,  give  mother gold, 
      circumstance  all; 
      child   advanced, 
   received   emperor's heir, 
  substituted   place  mine, 
  calm  tempest whirling   court; 
    emperor dandle    own. 
 hark ye, lords; ye      physic, 

 pointing   nurse      bestow  funeral; 
  fields  near,    gallant grooms: 
  done,      longer days, 
  send  midwife presently  me. 
  midwife   nurse   away, 
    ladies tattle   please.

      puts    shifts: 
    feed  berries   roots, 
  feed  curds  whey,  suck  goat, 
  cabin  a cave,  bring   
   a warrior,  command a camp.
