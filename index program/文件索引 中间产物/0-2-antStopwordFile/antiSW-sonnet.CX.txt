sonnet cxsonnet cxalas, 'tis true      
   a motley   view,
gored   thoughts, sold cheap    dear,
  offences  affections new;
 true      look'd  truth
askance  strangely: but,   above,
 blenches gave  heart  youth,
 worse essays proved thee    love.
   done,      end:
 appetite     grind
 newer proof,    older friend,
a god  love,     confined.
 give  welcome,   heaven  best,
  thy pure    loving breast.
