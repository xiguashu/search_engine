sonnet iisonnet iiwhen forty winters  beseige thy brow,
 dig deep trenches  thy beauty's field,
thy youth's proud livery,  gazed  now,
  a tatter'd weed,  small worth held:
  ask'd   thy beauty lies,
   treasure  thy lusty days,
 say,  thine  deep-sunken eyes,
  all-eating shame  thriftless praise.
   praise deserved thy beauty's use,
 thou couldst answer ' fair child  
 sum  count     excuse,'
proving  beauty  succession thine!
       thou art old,
  thy blood warm  thou feel'st  cold.
