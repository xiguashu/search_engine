sonnet vsonnet vthose hours,   gentle work  frame
 lovely gaze   eye doth dwell,
 play  tyrants    
  unfair   doth excel:
 never-resting time leads summer 
 hideous winter  confounds  there;
sap cheque'd  frost  lusty leaves  gone,
beauty o'ersnow'd  bareness  where:
then,   summer's distillation left,
a liquid prisoner pent  walls  glass,
beauty's effect  beauty  bereft,
    remembrance   was:
 flowers distill'd    winter meet,
leese   show;  substance  lives sweet.
