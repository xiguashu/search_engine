sonnet lviiisonnet lviiithat god forbid      slave,
   thought control  times  pleasure,
   hand  account  hours  crave,
  vassal, bound  stay  leisure!
o,   suffer,    beck,
 imprison'd absence   liberty;
 patience, tame  sufferance, bide  cheque,
 accusing   injury.
   list,  charter   strong
    privilege  time
   will;    doth belong
  pardon  self-doing crime.
   wait,  waiting   hell;
 blame  pleasure,   ill  well.
