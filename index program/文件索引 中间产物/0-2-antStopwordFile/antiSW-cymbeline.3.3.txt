    |      iii. wales: a mountainous country  a cave. 
 enter,   cave, belarius; guiderius,  arviragus   belarius  a goodly day    house,   
  roof's    ours! stoop, boys;  gate 
 instructs    adore  heavens  bows  
  a morning's holy office:  gates  monarchs 
  arch'd  high  giants  jet  
    impious turbans on,  
 good morrow   sun. hail, thou fair heaven! 
  house i'  rock,   thee    
  prouder livers do. 
 guiderius  hail, heaven! 
 arviragus  hail, heaven! 
 belarius     mountain sport:   yond hill; 
  legs  young;  tread  flats. consider, 
    perceive   a crow, 
    place  lessens  sets off; 
     revolve  tales   told  
  courts,  princes,   tricks  war: 
  service   service,   done, 
    allow'd:  apprehend thus, 
 draws  a profit     see; 
  often,   comfort,   find 
  sharded beetle  a safer hold 
    full-wing'd eagle. o,  life 
  nobler  attending  a cheque, 
 richer     a bauble, 
 prouder  rustling  unpaid-for silk: 
  gain  cap     'em fine, 
    book uncross'd:  life  ours. 
 guiderius     proof  speak: we, poor unfledged, 
   wing'd  view o'  nest,    
  air's  home. haply  life  best, 
  quiet life  best; sweeter   
   a sharper known;   
   stiff age:      
 a cell  ignorance; travelling a-bed; 
 a prison  a debtor,   dares 
  stride a limit. 
 arviragus     speak  
      you?    hear 
  rain  wind beat dark december, how, 
    pinching cave,   discourse 
  freezing hours away?    nothing; 
   beastly, subtle   fox  prey, 
  warlike   wolf    eat; 
  valour   chase  flies;  cage 
   a quire,  doth  prison'd bird, 
  sing  bondage freely. 
 belarius    speak! 
      city's usuries 
  felt  knowingly;  art o'  court 
  hard  leave  keep;  top  climb 
   falling,   slippery  
  fear's  bad  falling;  toil o'  war, 
 a pain     seek  danger 
 i'    fame  honour;  dies i' 
  search, 
  hath  oft a slanderous epitaph 
  record  fair act; nay,  times, 
 doth ill deserve   well;  worse, 
  court'sy   censure:--o boys,  story 
  world  read  me:  body's mark'd 
  roman swords,   report   
      note: cymbeline loved me, 
   a soldier   theme,   
    off:     a tree 
  boughs  bend  fruit:    night, 
 a storm  robbery, call    will, 
 shook   mellow hangings, nay,  leaves, 
  left  bare  weather. 
 guiderius  uncertain favour! 
 belarius   fault  nothing--as   told  oft-- 
    villains,  false oaths prevail'd 
   perfect honour, swore  cymbeline 
   confederate   romans:  
 follow'd  banishment,   twenty years 
  rock   demesnes    world; 
    lived  honest freedom, paid 
  pious debts  heaven    
  fore-end   time.     mountains! 
    hunters' language:   strikes 
  venison     lord o'  feast; 
       minister; 
    fear  poison,  attends 
  place  greater state.  meet    valleys. 

 exeunt guiderius  arviragus   hard    hide  sparks  nature! 
  boys     sons   king; 
  cymbeline dreams    alive. 
     mine;   train'd 
   meanly 
 i'  cave   bow,  thoughts  hit 
  roofs  palaces,  nature prompts  
  simple     prince   
   trick  others.  polydore, 
  heir  cymbeline  britain,  
  king  father call'd guiderius,--jove! 
    three-foot stool  sit   
  warlike feats   done,  spirits fly  
   story:  'thus,  enemy fell, 
    set  foot  's neck;'   
  princely blood flows   cheek,  sweats, 
 strains  young nerves  puts   posture 
  acts  words.  younger brother, cadwal, 
  arviragus,    a figure, 
 strikes life   speech  shows   
   conceiving.--hark,  game  roused! 
 o cymbeline! heaven   conscience  
 thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon, 
     years old,  stole  babes; 
 thinking  bar thee  succession,  
 thou reft'st    lands. euriphile, 
 thou wast  nurse;   thee  
  mother, 
   day  honour   grave: 
 myself, belarius,   morgan call'd, 
    natural father.  game  up.
