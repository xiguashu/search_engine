sonnet cisonnet cio truant muse,    thy amends
 thy neglect  truth  beauty dyed?
 truth  beauty   love depends;
 dost thou too,   dignified.
 answer, muse: wilt thou  haply 
'truth   colour,   colour fix'd;
beauty  pencil, beauty's truth  lay;
   best,   intermix'd?'
    praise, wilt thou  dumb?
excuse  silence so; for't lies  thee
    outlive a gilded tomb,
   praised  ages   be.
  thy office, muse;  teach thee 
    long    shows now.
