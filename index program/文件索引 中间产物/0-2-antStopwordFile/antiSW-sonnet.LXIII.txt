sonnet lxiiisonnet lxiiiagainst  love  be,    now,
 time's injurious hand crush'd  o'er-worn;
 hours  drain'd  blood  fill'd  brow
 lines  wrinkles;   youthful morn
hath travell'd   age's steepy night,
   beauties whereof   king
 vanishing  vanish'd   sight,
stealing   treasure   spring;
  a time    fortify
 confounding age's cruel knife,
    cut  memory
 sweet love's beauty,   lover's life:
 beauty    black lines  seen,
   live,      green.
