sonnet cxlvsonnet cxlvthose lips  love's  hand  
breathed   sound   ' hate'
   languish'd   sake;
     woeful state,
straight   heart  mercy come,
chiding  tongue   sweet
   giving gentle doom,
 taught   anew  greet:
' hate'  alter'd   end,
 follow'd   gentle day
doth follow night,   a fiend
 heaven  hell  flown away;
' hate'  hate   threw,
 saved  life,  ' you.'
