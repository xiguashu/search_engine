sonnet lxxxsonnet lxxxo,   faint      write,
knowing a  spirit doth   name,
   praise thereof spends   might,
   tongue-tied, speaking   fame!
   worth, wide   ocean is,
 humble   proudest sail doth bear,
 saucy bark inferior   
  broad main doth wilfully appear.
 shallowest   hold   afloat,
    soundless deep doth ride;
  wreck'd,   a worthless boat,
  tall building   goodly pride:
   thrive    cast away,
 worst  this;  love   decay.
