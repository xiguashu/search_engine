sonnet lxxviisonnet lxxviithy glass  show thee  thy beauties wear,
thy dial  thy precious minutes waste;
 vacant leaves thy mind's imprint  bear,
   book  learning mayst thou taste.
 wrinkles  thy glass   show
 mouthed graves  give thee memory;
thou  thy dial's shady stealth mayst 
time's thievish progress  eternity.
look,  thy memory   
commit   waste blanks,  thou shalt find
 children nursed, deliver'd  thy brain,
  a  acquaintance  thy mind.
 offices,  oft  thou wilt look,
 profit thee   enrich thy book.
