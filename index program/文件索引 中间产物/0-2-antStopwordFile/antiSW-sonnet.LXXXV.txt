sonnet lxxxvsonnet lxxxvmy tongue-tied muse  manners holds  still,
 comments   praise, richly compiled,
reserve  character  golden quill
 precious phrase    muses filed.
  good thoughts   write good words,
  unletter'd clerk  cry 'amen'
  hymn   spirit affords
 polish'd form  well-refined pen.
hearing  praised,   ''tis so, 'tis true,'

    breath  words respect,
   dumb thoughts, speaking  effect.
