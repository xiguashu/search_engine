sonnet xivsonnet xivnot   stars    judgment pluck;
  methinks   astronomy,
     good  evil luck,
 plagues,  dearths,  seasons' quality;
   fortune   minutes tell,
pointing    thunder, rain  wind,
   princes     well,
 oft predict    heaven find:
  thine eyes  knowledge  derive,
and, constant stars,    read  art
 truth  beauty   thrive,
  thyself  store thou wouldst convert;
   thee   prognosticate:
thy   truth's  beauty's doom  date.
