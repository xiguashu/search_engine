  syllable  dolour. 
 malcolm      wail, 
   believe,     redress, 
    find  time  friend,  will.

  pardon; 
      thoughts  transpose: 
 angels  bright still,   brightest fell; 
    foul  wear  brows  grace, 
  grace    so. 
 macduff    lost  hopes. 
 malcolm  perchance      find  doubts. 
    rawness left  wife  child, 
  precious motives,  strong knots  love, 
  leave-taking?  pray you,

 malcolm    offended: 
  speak    absolute fear  you. 
    country sinks beneath  yoke; 
  weeps,  bleeds;    day a gash 
  added   wounds:   withal 
    hands uplifted   right; 
    gracious england   offer 
  goodly thousands: but,   this, 
    tread   tyrant's head, 
  wear    sword,   poor country

    cold,  time    hoodwink. 
    dames enough:    
  vulture  you,  devour   
    greatness dedicate themselves,

 desire  jewels   other's house: 
   more-having    a sauce 
    hunger more;    forge 
 quarrels unjust   good  loyal, 
 destroying   wealth. 
 macduff   avarice 
 sticks deeper, grows   pernicious root 
  summer-seeming lust,   hath  
  sword   slain kings:    fear; 
 scotland hath foisons  fill   will. 
   mere own:    portable, 
   graces weigh'd. 
 malcolm     none:  king-becoming graces, 
  justice, verity, temperance, stableness, 
 bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness, 
 devotion, patience, courage, fortitude, 
    relish  them,  abound 
   division    crime, 
 acting   ways. nay,   power,

   untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd, 
  shalt thou  thy wholesome days again, 
    truest issue  thy throne

 deal  thee  me!    
  put   thy direction,  
 unspeak   detraction,  abjure 
  taints  blames  laid  myself,

   knows:  strangely-visited people, 
  swoln  ulcerous, pitiful   eye, 
  mere despair  surgery,  cures, 
 hanging a golden stamp   necks, 
 put   holy prayers:  'tis spoken, 
   succeeding royalty  leaves 
  healing benediction.   strange virtue, 
  hath a heavenly gift  prophecy, 
  sundry blessings hang   throne, 
  speak  full  grace.

  means    strangers! 
 ross  sir, amen. 
 macduff  stands scotland   did? 
 ross  alas, poor country! 
  afraid   itself.   
  call'd  mother,   grave;  nothing, 
    nothing,     smile; 
  sighs  groans  shrieks  rend  air 
  made,  mark'd;  violent sorrow  
 a modern ecstasy;  dead man's knell 
   scarce ask'd  who;  good men's lives 
 expire   flowers   caps, 
 dying  ere  sicken. 
 macduff  o, relation 
  nice,    true! 
 malcolm    newest grief? 
 ross     hour's age doth hiss  speaker: 
  minute teems a  one.

 ross  no;     peace    leave 'em. 
 macduff    a niggard   speech:  goes't? 
 ross       transport  tidings, 
    heavily borne,  ran a rumour 
   worthy fellows   out; 
     belief witness'd  rather, 
      tyrant's power a-foot: 
    time  help;  eye  scotland 
  create soldiers,   women fight, 
  doff  dire distresses. 
 malcolm  be't  comfort 
   coming thither: gracious england hath 
 lent  good siward  ten thousand men; 
  older  a  soldier  
  christendom  out. 
 ross     answer 
  comfort   like!    words 
    howl'd    desert air, 
  hearing   latch them. 
 macduff   concern they? 
  general cause?    a fee-grief 
 due   single breast? 
 ross   mind  honest 
    shares  woe;   main part 
 pertains   alone. 
 macduff     mine, 
     me, quickly    it. 
 ross     ears despise  tongue  ever, 
   possess    heaviest sound 
     heard. 
 macduff  hum!  guess  it. 
 ross   castle  surprised;  wife  babes 
 savagely slaughter'd:  relate  manner, 
 were,   quarry   murder'd deer, 
  add  death  you. 
 malcolm  merciful heaven! 
 what, man! ne'er pull  hat   brows; 
 give sorrow words:  grief    speak 
 whispers  o'er-fraught heart  bids  break. 
 macduff   children too? 
 ross  wife, children, servants,  
    found. 
 macduff       thence! 
  wife kill'd too? 
 ross    said. 
 malcolm   comforted: 
    medicines   great revenge, 
  cure  deadly grief. 
 macduff     children.   pretty ones? 
    all? o hell-kite! all? 
 what,   pretty chickens   dam 
   fell swoop?

 macduff     so; 
     feel   a man: 
    remember   were, 
    precious  me.  heaven  on, 
      part? sinful macduff, 
    struck  thee! naught   am, 
     demerits,   mine, 
 fell slaughter   souls. heaven rest  now! 
 malcolm     whetstone   sword:  grief 
 convert  anger; blunt   heart, enrage it. 
 macduff  o,   play  woman   eyes 
  braggart   tongue! but, gentle heavens, 
 cut short  intermission; front  front 
 bring thou  fiend  scotland  myself; 
   sword's length set him;   'scape, 
 heaven forgive  too! 
 malcolm   tune  manly. 
 come,     king;  power  ready; 
  lack     leave; macbeth 
  ripe  shaking,   powers  
 put   instruments. receive  cheer  may: 
  night  long   finds  day.
