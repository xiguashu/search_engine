sonnet xliisonnet xliithat thou hast her,      grief,
       loved  dearly;
  hath thee,    wailing chief,
a loss  love  touches   nearly.
loving offenders,    excuse ye:
thou dost love her,  thou knowst  love her;
   sake   doth  abuse me,
suffering  friend   sake  approve her.
  lose thee,  loss   love's gain,
 losing her,  friend hath   loss;
 find  other,   lose  twain,
    sake lay    cross:
   joy;  friend    one;
sweet flattery!   loves   alone.
