 enter,   walls, a master gunner   boy  master-gunner	sirrah, thou know'st  orleans  besieged, 
    english   suburbs won. 
 boy  father,  know;  oft  shot  them, 
 howe'er unfortunate  miss'd  aim. 
 master-gunner	  thou shalt not.  thou ruled  me: 
 chief master-gunner     town; 
      procure  grace. 
  prince's espials  informed  
   english,   suburbs close intrench'd, 
 wont,  a secret grate  iron bars 
  yonder tower,  overpeer  city, 
   discover    advantage 
   vex   shot,   assault. 
  intercept  inconvenience, 
 a piece  ordnance 'gainst    placed; 
     days   watch'd, 
     them. 
   thou watch,    stay  longer. 
  thou spy'st any, run  bring  word;

  wert thou handled  prisoner? 
    means got'st thou   released? 
 discourse,  prithee,   turret's top. 
 talbot   duke  bedford  a prisoner 
 call'd  brave lord ponton de santrailles; 
     exchanged  ransomed. 
   a baser   arms   
   contempt    barter'd me: 
  i, disdaining, scorn'd;  craved death, 
       vile esteem'd. 
  fine, redeem'd     desired. 
 but, o!  treacherous fastolfe wounds  heart, 
    bare fists   execute, 
      brought   power. 
 salisbury   tell'st thou   thou wert entertain'd. 
 talbot   scoffs  scorns  contumelious taunts. 
  open market-place produced  me, 
   a public spectacle  all: 
 here,  they,   terror   french, 
  scarecrow  affrights  children so. 
  broke    officers  led me, 
    nails digg'd stones    ground, 
  hurl   beholders   shame: 
  grisly countenance   fly; 
  durst    fear  sudden death. 
  iron walls  deem'd   secure; 
  great fear    'mongst   spread, 
   supposed   rend bars  steel, 
  spurn  pieces posts  adamant: 
 wherefore a guard  chosen shot  had, 
  walked    minute-while; 
      stir    bed, 
 ready    shoot    heart. 

 enter  boy  a linstock  salisbury   grieve  hear  torments  endured, 
     revenged sufficiently

 glansdale   i, here,   bulwark   bridge.

   light skirmishes enfeebled. 

   shoot. salisbury  gargrave fall  salisbury  o lord,  mercy  us, wretched sinners! 
 gargrave  o lord,  mercy  me, woful man! 
 talbot   chance    suddenly hath cross'd us? 
 speak, salisbury;  least,  thou canst speak: 
  farest thou, mirror   martial men? 
   thy eyes  thy cheek's side struck off! 
 accursed tower! accursed fatal hand 
  hath contrived  woful tragedy! 
  thirteen battles salisbury o'ercame; 
 henry     train'd   wars; 
   trump  sound,  drum struck up, 
  sword  ne'er leave striking   field. 
  livest thou, salisbury?  thy speech doth fail, 
  eye thou hast,    heaven  grace: 
  sun   eye vieweth   world. 
 heaven,  thou gracious   alive, 
  salisbury  mercy  thy hands! 
 bear   body;     bury it. 
 sir thomas gargrave, hast thou  life? 
 speak  talbot; nay,    him. 
 salisbury, cheer thy spirit   comfort; 
 thou shalt  die whiles-- 
  beckons   hand  smiles  me. 
     '   dead  gone, 
 remember  avenge    french.' 
 plantagenet,  will;   thee, nero, 
 play   lute, beholding  towns burn: 
 wretched  france     name.

  cometh  alarum   noise?

  irks  heart    revenged. 
 frenchmen,   a salisbury  you: 
 pucelle  puzzel, dolphin  dogfish, 
  hearts  stamp    horse's heels, 
   a quagmire   mingled brains.

       dastard frenchmen dare.
