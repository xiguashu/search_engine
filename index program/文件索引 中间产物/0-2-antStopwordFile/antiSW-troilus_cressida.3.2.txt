 enter pandarus  troilus's boy, meeting  pandarus   now!  thy master?   cousin 
 cressida's? 
 boy  no, sir;  stays    conduct  thither. 
 pandarus  o,   comes. 

 enter troilus   now,  now! 
 troilus  sirrah, walk off. 

 exit boy  pandarus      cousin? 
 troilus  no, pandarus:  stalk   door, 
  a strange soul   stygian banks 
 staying  waftage. o,  thou  charon, 
  give  swift transportance   fields 
    wallow   lily-beds 
 proposed   deserver! o gentle pandarus, 
  cupid's shoulder pluck  painted wings 
  fly    cressid! 
 pandarus  walk  i'  orchard,  bring  straight. 

 exit  troilus    giddy; expectation whirls  round. 
  imaginary relish   sweet 
   enchants  sense:    be, 
    watery palate tastes  
 love's thrice repured nectar? death,  fear me, 
 swooning destruction,   joy  fine, 
  subtle-potent, tuned  sharp  sweetness, 
   capacity   ruder powers: 
  fear  much;    fear besides, 
    lose distinction   joys; 
  doth a battle,   charge  heaps 
  enemy flying. 

 re-enter pandarus  pandarus   making  ready,   straight:  
   witty now.    blush,  fetches 
  wind  short,     frayed  a 
 sprite:  fetch her.    prettiest 
 villain:  fetches  breath  short  a 
 new-ta'en sparrow. 

 exit  troilus    a passion doth embrace  bosom: 
  heart beats thicker  a feverous pulse; 
    powers   bestowing lose, 
  vassalage  unawares encountering 
  eye  majesty. 

 re-enter pandarus  cressida  pandarus  come, come,    blush? shame's a baby. 
    now: swear  oaths     
   sworn  me. what,    again? 
    watched ere    tame,  you? 
   ways,   ways;   draw backward, 
  put  i'  fills.     speak  
 her? come, draw  curtain,     
 picture. alas  day,  loath    offend 
 daylight!  'twere dark, you'ld close sooner. 
 so, so; rub on,  kiss  mistress.  now! 
 a kiss  fee-farm! build there, carpenter;  air 
  sweet. nay,   fight  hearts  ere 
  part you.  falcon   tercel,    
 ducks i'  river:  to,  to. 
 troilus    bereft    words, lady. 
 pandarus  words pay  debts, give  deeds:   
 bereave  o'  deeds too,   call  
 activity  question. what, billing again?  
 ' witness whereof  parties interchangeably'-- 
  in,  in:    a fire. 

 exit  cressida    walk in,  lord? 
 troilus  o cressida,     wished  thus! 
 cressida  wished,  lord!  gods grant,--o  lord! 
 troilus     grant?    pretty 
 abruption?   curious dreg espies  sweet 
 lady   fountain   love? 
 cressida   dregs  water,   fears  eyes. 
 troilus  fears  devils  cherubims;    truly. 
 cressida  blind fear,   reason leads, finds safer 
 footing  blind reason stumbling  fear:  
 fear  worst oft cures  worse. 
 troilus  o,   lady apprehend  fear:   cupid's 
 pageant   presented  monster. 
 cressida    monstrous neither? 
 troilus  nothing,   undertakings;   vow  weep 
 seas, live  fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinking 
  harder   mistress  devise imposition 
      undergo  difficulty imposed. 
    monstruosity  love, lady,    
  infinite   execution confined,   
 desire  boundless    a slave  limit. 
 cressida     lovers swear  performance   
     reserve  ability    
 perform, vowing    perfection  ten  
 discharging    tenth part  one.  
    voice  lions     hares, 
    monsters? 
 troilus    such?    we: praise    
  tasted,     prove;  head   
 bare  merit crown it:  perfection  reversion 
   a praise  present:     
 desert   birth, and,  born,  addition 
   humble.  words  fair faith: troilus 
     cressid   envy   worst 
   a mock   truth,   truth  
 speak truest  truer  troilus. 
 cressida    walk in,  lord? 

 re-enter pandarus  pandarus  what, blushing still?     talking yet? 
 cressida  well, uncle,  folly  commit,  dedicate  you. 
 pandarus      that:   lord  a boy  you, 
  give  me.  true   lord:   
 flinch, chide   it. 
 troilus      hostages;  uncle's word   
 firm faith. 
 pandarus  nay,  give  word   too:  kindred, 
    long ere   wooed,   
 constant  won:   burs,    you; 
  stick    thrown. 
 cressida  boldness    now,  brings  heart. 
 prince troilus,   loved  night  day 
   weary months. 
 troilus     cressid   hard  win? 
 cressida  hard   won:    won,  lord, 
    glance  ever--pardon me-- 
   confess much,   play  tyrant. 
  love  now;  not,  now,   
    master it:  faith,  lie; 
  thoughts   unbridled children, grown 
  headstrong   mother. see,  fools! 
    blabb'd?    true  us, 
     unsecret  ourselves? 
 but,   loved  well,  woo'd  not; 
  yet, good faith,  wish'd  a man, 
    women  men's privilege 
  speaking first. sweet, bid  hold  tongue, 
    rapture   surely speak 
     repent. see, see,  silence, 
 cunning  dumbness,   weakness draws 
   soul  counsel! stop  mouth. 
 troilus   shall, albeit sweet music issues thence. 
 pandarus  pretty, i' faith. 
 cressida   lord,   beseech you, pardon me; 
 'twas   purpose,   beg a kiss: 
   ashamed. o heavens!    done? 
   time     leave,  lord. 
 troilus   leave, sweet cressid! 
 pandarus  leave!    leave  to-morrow morning,-- 
 cressida  pray you, content you. 
 troilus   offends you, lady? 
 cressida  sir,   company. 
 troilus    shun yourself. 
 cressida      try: 
   a kind   resides  you; 
   unkind self,    leave, 
   another's fool.    gone: 
    wit?      speak. 
 troilus       speak  speak  wisely. 
 cressida  perchance,  lord,  show  craft  love; 
  fell  roundly  a large confession, 
  angle   thoughts:    wise, 
    love not,    wise  love 
 exceeds man's might;  dwells  gods above. 
 troilus  o   thought     a woman-- 
 as,   can,   presume  you-- 
  feed  aye  ramp  flames  love; 
    constancy  plight  youth, 
 outliving beauty's outward,  a mind 
  doth renew swifter  blood decays! 
   persuasion    convince me, 
   integrity  truth   
   affronted   match  weight 
   a winnow'd purity  love; 
     uplifted! but, alas! 
    true  truth's simplicity 
  simpler   infancy  truth. 
 cressida     war  you. 
 troilus  o virtuous fight, 
     wars     right! 
 true swains  love    world   
 approve  truths  troilus:   rhymes, 
 full  protest,  oath  big compare, 
  similes, truth tired  iteration, 
  true  steel,  plantage   moon, 
  sun  day,  turtle   mate, 
  iron  adamant,  earth   centre, 
 yet,   comparisons  truth, 
  truth's authentic author   cited, 
 ' true  troilus'  crown   verse, 
  sanctify  numbers. 
 cressida  prophet   be! 
    false,  swerve a hair  truth, 
  time    hath forgot itself, 
  waterdrops  worn  stones  troy, 
  blind oblivion swallow'd cities up, 
  mighty states characterless  grated 
  dusty nothing,   memory, 
  false  false,  false maids  love, 
 upbraid  falsehood!    ' false 
  air,  water, wind,  sandy earth, 
  fox  lamb,  wolf  heifer's calf, 
 pard   hind,  stepdame   son,' 
 'yea,'   say,  stick  heart  falsehood, 
 ' false  cressid.' 
 pandarus   to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it;    
 witness.   hold  hand,   cousin's. 
    prove false   another,    
   pains  bring  together,   
 pitiful goers-between  called   world's  
   name; call   pandars;   
 constant men  troiluses,  false women cressids, 
   brokers-between pandars! say, amen. 
 troilus  amen. 
 cressida  amen. 
 pandarus  amen.    show  a chamber  a 
 bed;  bed,     speak   
 pretty encounters, press   death: away! 
  cupid grant  tongue-tied maidens  
 bed, chamber, pandar  provide  gear!
