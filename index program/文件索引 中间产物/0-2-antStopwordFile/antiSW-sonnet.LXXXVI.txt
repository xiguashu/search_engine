sonnet lxxxvisonnet lxxxviwas   proud full sail   great verse,
bound   prize    precious you,
   ripe thoughts   brain inhearse,
making  tomb  womb   grew?
   spirit,  spirits taught  write
 a mortal pitch,  struck  dead?
no,  he,   compeers  night
giving  aid,  verse astonished.
he,   affable familiar ghost
 nightly gulls   intelligence
 victors   silence  boast;
   sick   fear  thence:
   countenance fill'd   line,
 lack'd  matter;  enfeebled mine.
