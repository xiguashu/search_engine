sonnet civsonnet civto me, fair friend,     old,
       eye  eyed,
   beauty still.  winters cold
   forests shook  summers' pride,
 beauteous springs  yellow autumn turn'd
 process   seasons   seen,
 april perfumes   hot junes burn'd,
     fresh,    green.
ah!  doth beauty,  a dial-hand,
steal   figure   pace perceived;
  sweet hue,  methinks  doth stand,
hath motion   eye   deceived:
 fear  which, hear this, thou age unbred;
ere   born  beauty's summer dead.
