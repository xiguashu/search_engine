    prologue 
 enter gower 
   palace  antioch   sing a song    sung, 
  ashes ancient gower  come; 
 assuming man's infirmities, 
  glad  ear,    eyes. 
  hath  sung  festivals, 
  ember-eves  holy-ales; 
  lords  ladies   lives 
  read   restoratives: 
  purchase    men glorious; 
  bonum quo antiquius, eo melius. 
  you, born    times, 
  wit's  ripe, accept  rhymes. 
    hear    sing 
    wishes pleasure bring 
  life  wish,     
 waste   you,  taper-light. 
  antioch, then, antiochus  great 
 built up,  city,   chiefest seat: 
  fairest   syria, 
      authors say: 
  king    a fere, 
  died  left a female heir, 
  buxom, blithe,  full  face, 
  heaven  lent    grace; 
    father liking took, 
    incest  provoke: 
 bad child; worse father!  entice   
  evil     none: 
  custom     
   long  account  sin. 
  beauty   sinful dame 
   princes thither frame, 
  seek   a bed-fellow, 
  marriage-pleasures play-fellow: 
   prevent   a law, 
    still,  men  awe, 
  whoso ask'd    wife, 
  riddle told not, lost  life: 
     a wight  die, 
  yon grim   testify. 
   ensues,   judgment   eye 
  give,      justify.
