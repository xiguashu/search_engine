sonnet cxviisonnet cxviiaccuse  thus:    scanted 
    great deserts repay,
forgot   dearest love  call,
whereto  bonds  tie  day  day;
   frequent   unknown minds
   time   dear-purchased 
   hoisted sail    winds
  transport  farthest   sight.
book   wilfulness  errors 
   proof surmise accumulate;
bring    level   frown,
 shoot      waken'd hate;
  appeal    strive  prove
 constancy  virtue   love.
