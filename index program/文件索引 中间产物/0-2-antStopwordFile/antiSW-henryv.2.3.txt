 enter pistol, hostess, nym, bardolph,  boy  hostess  prithee, honey-sweet husband,   bring thee  staines. 
 pistol  no;   manly heart doth yearn. 
 bardolph,  blithe: nym, rouse thy vaunting veins: 
 boy, bristle thy courage up;  falstaff   dead, 
    yearn therefore. 
 bardolph      him, wheresome'er  is,   
 heaven   hell! 
 hostess  nay, sure,    hell:   arthur's 
 bosom,      arthur's bosom. a'  
 a finer          
 christom child; a' parted    twelve 
  one,    turning o'  tide:   
    fumble   sheets  play  
 flowers  smile   fingers' ends,  knew 
     way;   nose   sharp  
 a pen,  a' babbled  green fields. ' now, 
 sir john!' quoth 	'what, man!  o' good 
 cheer.'  a' cried  'god, god, god!'   
  times.  i,  comfort him, bid  a' 
     god;  hoped     
  trouble     thoughts yet.  
 a' bade  lay  clothes   feet:  put  
 hand   bed  felt them,     
 cold   stone;   felt   knees,  
    cold   stone,   upward  
 upward,     cold   stone.

 hostess  farewell; adieu.
