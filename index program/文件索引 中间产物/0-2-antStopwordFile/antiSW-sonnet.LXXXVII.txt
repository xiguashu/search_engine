sonnet lxxxviisonnet lxxxviifarewell! thou art  dear   possessing,
   thou know'st thy estimate:
 charter  thy worth  thee releasing;
 bonds  thee   determinate.
    hold thee   thy granting?
   riches    deserving?
    fair gift    wanting,
   patent    swerving.
thyself thou gavest, thy  worth   knowing,
 me,   thou gavest it,  mistaking;
 thy great gift,  misprision growing,
 home again,   judgment making.
    thee,  a dream doth flatter,
 sleep a king,  waking   matter.
