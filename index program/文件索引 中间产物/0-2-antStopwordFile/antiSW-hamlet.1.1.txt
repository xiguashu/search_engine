  frown'd  once, when,   angry parle, 
  smote  sledded polacks   ice. 
 'tis strange. 
 marcellus    before,  jump   dead hour, 
  martial stalk hath     watch. 
 horatio     thought  work   not;

 thereto prick'd   a  emulate pride, 
 dared   combat;    valiant hamlet-- 
    side    world esteem'd him-- 
  slay  fortinbras;   a seal'd compact, 
  ratified  law  heraldry, 
  forfeit,   life,    lands 
   stood seized of,   conqueror: 
   which, a moiety competent 
  gaged   king;   return'd 
   inheritance  fortinbras, 
    vanquisher; as,    covenant, 
  carriage   article design'd,

  armed   watch;    king 
      question   wars. 
 horatio  a mote    trouble  mind's eye. 
    high  palmy state  rome, 
 a  ere  mightiest julius fell, 
  graves stood tenantless   sheeted dead 
  squeak  gibber   roman streets: 
  stars  trains  fire  dews  blood, 
 disasters   sun;   moist star 
   influence neptune's empire stands 
  sick   doomsday  eclipse: 
     precurse  fierce events, 
  harbingers preceding   fates 
  prologue   omen coming on, 
  heaven  earth  demonstrated 
   climatures  countrymen.-- 
  soft, behold! lo,    again! 

 re-enter ghost   cross it,   blast me. stay, illusion!

 which, happily, foreknowing  avoid, o, speak! 
   thou hast uphoarded  thy life 
 extorted treasure   womb  earth, 
  which,  say,  spirits oft walk  death, 
 speak  it: stay,  speak! stop it, marcellus. 
 marcellus    strike     partisan? 
 horatio  do,     stand. 
 bernardo  'tis here! 
 horatio  'tis here! 
 marcellus  'tis gone! 

 exit ghost     wrong,   majestical, 
  offer   show  violence; 
   is,   air, invulnerable, 
   vain blows malicious mockery. 
 bernardo      speak,   cock crew. 
 horatio     started  a guilty  
  a fearful summons.   heard, 
  cock,    trumpet   morn, 
 doth   lofty  shrill-sounding throat 
 awake  god  day; and,   warning, 
   sea  fire,  earth  air, 
  extravagant  erring spirit hies 
   confine:    truth  
  present object  probation. 
 marcellus   faded   crowing   cock. 
     'gainst  season  
   saviour's birth  celebrated, 
  bird  dawning singeth  night long: 
  then,  say,  spirit dares stir abroad; 
  nights  wholesome;   planets strike, 
  fairy takes,  witch hath power  charm, 
  hallow'd   gracious   time. 
 horatio     heard    part  it. 
 but, look,  morn,  russet mantle clad, 
 walks o'er  dew  yon high eastward hill: 
 break   watch up;    advice, 
   impart     to-night 
  young hamlet; for,   life, 
  spirit, dumb  us,  speak  him. 
   consent   acquaint   it, 
  needful   loves, fitting  duty? 
 marcellus   do't,  pray;    morning  
    find   conveniently.
