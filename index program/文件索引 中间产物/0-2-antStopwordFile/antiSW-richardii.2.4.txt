    |      iv. a camp  wales. 
 enter earl  salisbury  a welsh captain  captain   lord  salisbury,   stay'd ten days, 
     countrymen together, 
    hear  tidings   king; 
    disperse ourselves: farewell. 
 earl  salisbury  stay   day, thou trusty welshman: 
  king reposeth   confidence  thee. 
 captain  'tis thought  king  dead;    stay. 
  bay-trees   country   wither'd 
  meteors fright  fixed stars  heaven; 
  pale-faced moon  bloody   earth 
  lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change; 
 rich men  sad  ruffians dance  leap, 
    fear  lose   enjoy, 
    enjoy  rage  war: 
  signs forerun  death  fall  kings. 
 farewell:  countrymen    fled, 
   assured richard  king  dead. 

 exit  earl  salisbury  ah, richard,   eyes  heavy mind 
   thy glory  a shooting star 
 fall   base earth   firmament. 
 thy sun sets weeping   lowly west, 
 witnessing storms  come, woe  unrest: 
 thy friends  fled  wait  thy foes, 
  crossly  thy good  fortune goes.
