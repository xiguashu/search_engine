sonnet xxviisonnet xxviiweary  toil,  haste    bed,
 dear repose  limbs  travel tired;
  begins a journey   head,
 work  mind,  body's work's expired:
   thoughts,     abide,
intend a zealous pilgrimage  thee,
   drooping eyelids open wide,
  darkness   blind  
save   soul's imaginary sight
presents thy shadow   sightless view,
which,  a jewel hung  ghastly night,
 black night beauteous    face new.
lo! thus,  day  limbs,  night  mind,
 thee     quiet find.
