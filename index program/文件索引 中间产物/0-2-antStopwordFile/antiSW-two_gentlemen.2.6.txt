    |      vi.  same.  duke's palace. 
 enter proteus  proteus   leave  julia,    forsworn; 
  love fair silvia,    forsworn; 
  wrong  friend,     forsworn; 
    power  gave    oath 
 provokes    threefold perjury; 
 love bade  swear  love bids  forswear. 
 o sweet-suggesting love,  thou hast sinned, 
 teach me, thy tempted subject,  excuse it! 
     adore a twinkling star, 
    worship a celestial sun. 
 unheedful vows  heedfully  broken, 
    wit   resolved  
  learn  wit  exchange  bad  better. 
 fie, fie, unreverend tongue!  call  bad, 
  sovereignty  oft thou hast preferr'd 
  twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths. 
   leave  love,    do; 
    leave  love    love. 
 julia  lose  valentine  lose: 
    them,    lose myself; 
   lose them,  find    loss 
  valentine myself,  julia silvia. 
     dearer  a friend, 
  love    precious  itself; 
  silvia--witness heaven,    fair!-- 
 shows julia  a swarthy ethiope. 
   forget  julia  alive, 
 remembering   love    dead; 
  valentine  hold  enemy, 
 aiming  silvia  a sweeter friend. 
    prove constant  myself, 
   treachery   valentine. 
  night  meaneth  a corded ladder 
  climb celestial silvia's chamber-window, 
   counsel,  competitor. 
  presently  give  father notice 
   disguising  pretended flight; 
 who,  enraged,  banish valentine; 
  thurio,  intends,  wed  daughter; 
 but, valentine  gone,  quickly cross 
   sly trick blunt thurio's dull proceeding. 
 love, lend  wings    purpose swift, 
  thou hast lent  wit  plot  drift!
