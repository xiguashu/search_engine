sonnet cvisonnet cviwhen   chronicle  wasted time
  descriptions   fairest wights,
 beauty making beautiful  rhyme
 praise  ladies dead  lovely knights,
then,   blazon  sweet beauty's best,
 hand,  foot,  lip,  eye,  brow,
   antique pen   express'd
  a beauty   master now.
   praises   prophecies
   time,   prefiguring;
and,   look'd   divining eyes,
   skill   worth  sing:
 we,   behold  present days,
 eyes  wonder,  lack tongues  praise.
