sonnet xlvisonnet xlvimine eye  heart   a mortal war
  divide  conquest  thy sight;
 eye  heart thy picture's sight  bar,
 heart  eye  freedom   right.
 heart doth plead  thou   dost lie--
a closet  pierced  crystal eyes--
  defendant doth  plea deny
    thy fair appearance lies.
 'cide  title  impanneled
a quest  thoughts,  tenants   heart,
   verdict  determined
 clear eye's moiety   dear heart's part:
 thus;  eye's due  thy outward part,
  heart's  thy  love  heart.
