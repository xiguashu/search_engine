  say,      plagues  mercy, 
  linger    destructions on! 
 aeneas   lord,   discomfort   host!

    speak  flight,  fear,  death, 
    imminence  gods  men 
 address  dangers in. hector  gone: 
    priam so,  hecuba? 
     a screech-owl aye  call'd, 
    troy,   there, hector's dead: 
   a word  priam turn  stone; 
  wells  niobes   maids  wives, 
 cold statues   youth, and,  a word, 
 scare troy   itself. but, march away: 
 hector  dead;      say. 
 stay yet.  vile abominable tents, 
  proudly pight   phrygian plains, 
  titan rise  early   dare, 
     you! and, thou great-sized coward,

  mouldeth goblins swift  frenzy's thoughts. 
 strike a free march  troy!  comfort go: 
 hope  revenge  hide   woe.
