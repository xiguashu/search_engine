 alencon    so.

   amazed,   hid  me: 
  private   talk  thee apart. 
 stand back,  lords,  give  leave awhile. 
 reignier   takes   bravely   dash. 
 joan la pucelle  dauphin,    birth a shepherd's daughter, 
  wit untrain'd   kind  art. 
 heaven   lady gracious hath  pleased 
  shine   contemptible estate: 
 lo,   waited   tender lambs, 
   sun's parching heat display'd  cheeks, 
 god's mother deigned     
   a vision full  majesty 
 will'd   leave  base vocation 
  free  country  calamity: 
  aid  promised  assured success: 
  complete glory  reveal'd herself; 
 and,    black  swart before, 
   clear rays   infused   
  beauty   bless'd    see.

  single combat thou shalt buckle  me, 
   thou vanquishest, thy words  true; 
   renounce  confidence. 
 joan la pucelle    prepared:    keen-edged sword, 
 deck'd   flower-de-luces   side; 
    touraine,  saint katharine's 
 churchyard, 
   a great deal   iron  chose forth.

   broad spreading  disperse  nought. 
  henry's death  english circle ends; 
 dispersed   glories  included. 
      proud insulting ship 
  caesar   fortune bare  once. 
 charles   mahomet inspired  a dove? 
 thou   eagle art inspired then. 
 helen,  mother  great constantine, 
   saint philip's daughters,   thee. 
 bright star  venus, fall'n    earth,

  prophet   trust,   prove false.
