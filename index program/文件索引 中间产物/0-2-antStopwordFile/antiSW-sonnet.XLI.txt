sonnet xlisonnet xlithose petty wrongs  liberty commits,
    absent  thy heart,
thy beauty  thy years full  befits,
  temptation   thou art.
gentle thou art     won,
beauteous thou art,    assailed;
  a woman woos,  woman's son
 sourly leave     prevailed?
ay me!   thou mightest  seat forbear,
 chide  beauty  thy straying youth,
 lead thee   riot  
 thou art forced  break a twofold truth,
  thy beauty tempting   thee,
thine,  thy beauty  false  me.
