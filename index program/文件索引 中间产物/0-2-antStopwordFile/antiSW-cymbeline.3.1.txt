  conquer'd it, cassibelan, thine uncle,-- 
 famous  caesar's praises,  whit  
    feats deserving it--for  
   succession granted rome a tribute, 
 yearly  thousand pounds,   thee  
  left untender'd. 
 queen  and,  kill  marvel, 
    ever. 
 cloten     caesars, 
 ere   julius. britain  
 a world  itself;     pay 
  wearing   noses. 
 queen   opportunity 
        's,  resume 
   again. remember, sir,  liege, 
  kings  ancestors,   
  natural bravery   isle,  stands 
  neptune's park, ribbed  paled  
  rocks unscalable  roaring waters, 
  sands    bear  enemies' boats, 
  suck     topmast. a kind  conquest 
 caesar  here;      brag 
  'came'  'saw'  'overcame: '  shame-- 
     touch'd him--he  carried 
    coast,  beaten;   shipping-- 
 poor ignorant baubles!--   terrible seas, 
  egg-shells moved   surges, crack'd 
  easily 'gainst  rocks:  joy whereof 
  famed cassibelan,     point-- 
 o giglot fortune!--to master caesar's sword, 
  lud's town  rejoicing fires bright 
  britons strut  courage.

  adventure,  crows  fare   
  you;    end. 
 caius lucius  so, sir. 
 cymbeline     master's pleasure   mine: 
   remain  'welcome!'
