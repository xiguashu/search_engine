 eager compounds   palate urge,
as,  prevent  maladies unseen,

 so,  tuff   ne'er-cloying sweetness,
 bitter sauces   frame  feeding
and, sick  welfare,  a kind  meetness
  diseased ere    true needing.

 brought  medicine a healthful state
which, rank  goodness,   ill  cured:

drugs poison    fell sick  you.
