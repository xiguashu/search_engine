  promised,   parted   king, 
  lay  life-harming heaviness 
  entertain a cheerful disposition. 
 queen     king  did;    
    it;      
      a guest  grief, 
 save bidding farewell   sweet a guest 
   sweet richard:  again, methinks, 
  unborn sorrow, ripe  fortune's womb, 
  coming  me,    soul 
   trembles:     grieves, 
    parting   lord  king. 
 bushy   substance  a grief hath twenty shadows, 
  shows  grief itself,    so; 
  sorrow's eye, glazed  blinding tears, 
 divides   entire   objects; 
  perspectives,  rightly gazed  
 show   confusion, eyed awry 
 distinguish form:   sweet majesty, 
  awry   lord's departure, 
 find shapes  grief,   himself,  wail; 
 which, look'd    is,  nought  shadows 
     not. then, thrice-gracious queen, 
    lord's departure weep not: more's  seen; 
    be, 'tis  false sorrow's eye, 
    true weeps  imaginary. 
 queen     so;     soul 
 persuades    otherwise: howe'er  be, 
     sad;  heavy sad 
 as,   thinking   thought  think, 
    heavy  faint  shrink. 
 bushy  'tis   conceit,  gracious lady. 
 queen  'tis  less: conceit   derived 
   forefather grief;    so, 
    begot   grief; 
   hath     grieve:

    is,     known;  
   name; 'tis nameless woe,  wot.

  wherefore dost thou hope    shipp'd? 
 green   he,  hope,   retired  power, 
  driven  despair  enemy's hope, 
  strongly hath set footing   land: 
  banish'd bolingbroke repeals himself, 
   uplifted arms  safe arrived 
  ravenspurgh. 
 queen   god  heaven forbid! 
 green  ah, madam, 'tis  true:    worse,

  woe  woe, sorrow  sorrow join'd. 
 bushy  despair not, madam. 
 queen    hinder me? 
   despair,    enmity 
  cozening hope:   a flatterer, 
 a parasite, a keeper   death, 
  gently  dissolve  bands  life, 
  false hope lingers  extremity.

 queen   signs  war   aged neck: 
 o, full  careful business   looks! 
 uncle,  god's sake, speak comfortable words. 
 duke  york     so,   belie  thoughts: 
 comfort's  heaven;      earth, 
   lives  crosses, cares  grief. 
  husband,     save  off, 
       lose  home: 
    left  underprop  land,
