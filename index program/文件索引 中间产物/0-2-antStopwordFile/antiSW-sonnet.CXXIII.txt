sonnet cxxiiisonnet cxxiiino, time, thou shalt  boast    change:
thy pyramids built   newer 
    novel,  strange;
   dressings  a  sight.
 dates  brief,    admire
 thou dost foist     old,
    born   desire
      heard  told.
thy registers  thee   defy,
 wondering   present   past,
 thy records     doth lie,
     thy continual haste.
   vow     be;
   true,  thy scythe  thee.
