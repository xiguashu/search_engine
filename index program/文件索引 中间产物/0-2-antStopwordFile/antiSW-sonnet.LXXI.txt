sonnet lxxisonnet lxxino longer mourn      dead
   hear  surly sullen bell
give warning   world    fled
  vile world,  vilest worms  dwell:
nay,   read  line, remember 
 hand  writ it;   love  
    sweet thoughts   forgot
 thinking       woe.
o, if,  say,     verse
   compounded   clay,
      poor  rehearse.
   love    life decay,
  wise world     moan
 mock       gone.
