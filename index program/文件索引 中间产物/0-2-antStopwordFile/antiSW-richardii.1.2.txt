 enter john  gaunt  duchess  john  gaunt  alas,  part    woodstock's blood 
 doth  solicit    exclaims, 
  stir   butchers   life! 
   correction lieth   hands 
    fault    correct, 
 put   quarrel     heaven; 
 who,     hours ripe  earth, 
  rain hot vengeance  offenders' heads. 
 duchess  finds brotherhood  thee  sharper spur? 
 hath love  thy  blood  living fire? 
 edward's  sons, whereof thyself art one, 
    vials   sacred blood, 
   fair branches springing   root: 
      dried  nature's course, 
    branches   destinies cut; 
  thomas,  dear lord,  life,  gloucester, 
  vial full  edward's sacred blood, 
  flourishing branch    royal root, 
  crack'd,    precious liquor spilt, 
  hack'd down,   summer leaves  faded, 
  envy's hand  murder's bloody axe. 
 ah, gaunt,  blood  thine!  bed,  womb, 
  metal,  self-mould,  fashion'd thee 
   a man;   thou livest  breathest, 
  art thou slain  him: thou dost consent 
   large measure  thy father's death, 
   thou seest thy wretched brother die, 
    model  thy father's life. 
 call   patience, gaunt;   despair: 
  suffering  thy brother   slaughter'd, 
 thou showest  naked pathway  thy life, 
 teaching stern murder   butcher thee: 
     men  intitle patience 
  pale cold cowardice  noble breasts. 
    say?  safeguard thine  life, 
      venge  gloucester's death. 
 john  gaunt  god's   quarrel;  god's substitute, 
  deputy anointed   sight, 
 hath caused  death:    wrongfully, 
  heaven revenge;     lift 
  angry arm   minister. 
 duchess   then, alas,   complain myself? 
 john  gaunt   god,  widow's champion  defence. 
 duchess  why, then,  will. farewell,  gaunt. 
 thou goest  coventry,   behold 
  cousin hereford  fell mowbray fight: 
 o, sit  husband's wrongs  hereford's spear, 
    enter butcher mowbray's breast! 
 or,  misfortune    career, 
  mowbray's sins  heavy   bosom, 
   break  foaming courser's back, 
  throw  rider headlong   lists, 
 a caitiff recreant   cousin hereford! 
 farewell,  gaunt: thy  brother's wife 
   companion grief    life. 
 john  gaunt  sister, farewell;    coventry: 
   good stay  thee    me! 
 duchess    word more: grief boundeth   falls, 
    empty hollowness,  weight: 
    leave    begun, 
  sorrow ends    seemeth done. 
 commend   thy brother, edmund york. 
 lo,   all:--nay,  depart  so; 
    all,    quickly go; 
   remember more. bid him--ah, what?-- 
   good speed  plashy visit me. 
 alack,    good  york   
  empty lodgings  unfurnish'd walls, 
 unpeopled offices, untrodden stones? 
   hear      groans? 
  commend me;     there, 
  seek  sorrow  dwells  where. 
 desolate, desolate,     die: 
   leave  thee takes  weeping eye.
