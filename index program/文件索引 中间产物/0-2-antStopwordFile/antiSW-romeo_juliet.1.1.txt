    tyrannous  rough  proof! 
 romeo  alas,  love,  view  muffled still, 
 should,  eyes,  pathways   will! 
    dine? o me!  fray  here? 
    not,    heard  all. 
      hate,    love. 
 why, then, o brawling love! o loving hate! 
 o  thing,    create! 
 o heavy lightness!  vanity! 
 mis-shapen chaos  well-seeming forms! 
 feather  lead, bright smoke, cold fire, 
 sick health! 
 still-waking sleep,      is! 
  love feel i,  feel  love  this. 
 dost thou  laugh?

 romeo  why,   love's transgression. 
 griefs    lie heavy   breast, 
  thou wilt propagate,    prest 
    thine:  love  thou hast shown 
 doth add  grief      own. 
 love  a smoke raised   fume  sighs; 
  purged, a fire sparkling  lovers' eyes; 
  vex'd a sea nourish'd  lovers' tears: 
    else? a madness  discreet, 
 a choking gall  a preserving sweet. 
 farewell,  coz.

 romeo  well,   hit  miss:    hit 
  cupid's arrow;  hath dian's wit; 
 and,  strong proof  chastity  arm'd, 
  love's weak childish bow  lives unharm'd. 
    stay  siege  loving terms, 
  bide  encounter  assailing eyes, 
  ope  lap  saint-seducing gold: 
 o,   rich  beauty,  poor, 
    dies  beauty dies  store. 
 benvolio    hath sworn     live chaste? 
 romeo   hath,    sparing  huge waste, 
  beauty starved   severity 
 cuts beauty    posterity. 
    fair,  wise, wisely  fair, 
  merit bliss  making  despair: 
  hath forsworn  love,    vow 
   live dead  live    now. 
 benvolio   ruled  me, forget    her. 
 romeo  o, teach     forget  think. 
 benvolio   giving liberty  thine eyes; 
 examine  beauties. 
 romeo  'tis   
  call  exquisite,  question more: 
  happy masks  kiss fair ladies' brows 
  black put   mind  hide  fair; 
    strucken blind  forget 
  precious treasure   eyesight lost: 
 show  a mistress   passing fair, 
  doth  beauty serve,   a note 
    read  pass'd  passing fair? 
 farewell: thou canst  teach   forget. 
 benvolio   pay  doctrine,   die  debt.
