     i.  king  navarre's park. 
 enter ferdinand king  navarre, biron, longaville  dumain  ferdinand   fame,   hunt    lives, 
 live register'd   brazen tombs 
   grace    disgrace  death; 
 when, spite  cormorant devouring time, 
  endeavor   present breath  buy 
  honour   bate  scythe's keen edge 
    heirs   eternity. 
 therefore, brave conquerors,--for   are, 
  war    affections 
   huge army   world's desires,-- 
  late edict  strongly stand  force: 
 navarre       world; 
  court   a  academe, 
   contemplative  living art. 
  three, biron, dumain,  longaville, 
  sworn   years' term  live   
  fellow-scholars,     statutes 
   recorded   schedule here: 
  oaths  pass'd;   subscribe  names, 
    hand  strike  honour  
  violates  smallest branch herein: 
    arm'd    sworn  do, 
 subscribe   deep oaths,    too. 
 longaville    resolved; 'tis  a  years' fast: 
  mind  banquet,   body pine: 
 fat paunches  lean pates,  dainty bits 
  rich  ribs,  bankrupt   wits. 
 dumain   loving lord, dumain  mortified: 
  grosser manner   world's delights 
  throws   gross world's baser slaves: 
  love,  wealth,  pomp,  pine  die; 
    living  philosophy. 
 biron       protestation over; 
  much, dear liege,    sworn, 
  is,  live  study   years. 
     strict observances; 
 as,    a woman   term, 
   hope    enrolled there; 
   day  a week  touch  food 
    meal   day beside, 
    hope   enrolled there; 
  then,  sleep   hours   night, 
      wink    day-- 
    wont    harm  night 
   a dark night     day-- 
   hope    enrolled there: 
 o,   barren tasks,  hard  keep, 
    ladies, study, fast,  sleep! 
 ferdinand   oath  pass'd  pass   these. 
 biron     no,  liege,    please: 
   swore  study   grace 
  stay    court   years' space. 
 longaville   swore  that, biron,    rest. 
 biron   yea  nay, sir,   swore  jest. 
      study?   know. 
 ferdinand  why,   know,      know. 
 biron   hid  barr'd,  mean,  common sense? 
 ferdinand  ay,   study's godlike recompense. 
 biron   on, then;   swear  study so, 
       forbid  know: 
  thus,--to study     dine, 
    feast expressly  forbid; 
  study   meet  mistress fine, 
  mistresses  common sense  hid; 
 or,  sworn  hard a keeping oath, 
 study  break    break  troth. 
  study's gain      so, 
 study      doth  know: 
 swear   this,    ne'er  no. 
 ferdinand     stops  hinder study  
  train  intellects  vain delight. 
 biron  why,  delights  vain;    vain, 
   pain purchased doth inherit pain: 
 as, painfully  pore  a book 
  seek  light  truth;  truth   
 doth falsely blind  eyesight   look: 
 light seeking light doth light  light beguile: 
 so, ere  find  light  darkness lies, 
  light grows dark  losing   eyes. 
 study      eye  
  fixing   a fairer eye, 
  dazzling so,  eye    heed 
  give  light    blinded by. 
 study    heaven's glorious sun 
     deep-search'd  saucy looks: 
 small  continual plodders  won 
 save base authority  others' books 
  earthly godfathers  heaven's lights 
  give a    fixed star 
    profit   shining nights 
    walk  wot    are. 
        nought  fame; 
   godfather  give a name. 
 ferdinand     read,  reason  reading! 
 dumain  proceeded well,  stop  good proceeding! 
 longaville   weeds  corn   lets grow  weeding. 
 biron   spring    green geese  a-breeding. 
 dumain    that? 
 biron  fit   place  time. 
 dumain   reason nothing. 
 biron     rhyme. 
 ferdinand  biron    envious sneaping frost, 
  bites  first-born infants   spring. 
 biron  well,   am;   proud summer boast 
   birds     sing? 
    joy   abortive birth? 
  christmas    desire a rose 
   a snow  may's new-fangled mirth; 
        season grows. 
  you,  study     late, 
 climb o'er  house  unlock   gate. 
 ferdinand  well, sit  out:  home, biron: adieu. 
 biron  no,  good lord;   sworn  stay  you:

    angel knowledge   say, 
  confident      swore 
  bide  penance    years' day.

  vainly   admired princess hither. 
 ferdinand    you, lords? why,    forgot. 
 biron   study   overshot: 
   doth study      
  doth forget      should, 
    hath    hunteth most, 
 'tis won  towns  fire,  won,  lost. 
 ferdinand     force dispense   decree; 
   lie   mere necessity. 
 biron  necessity     forsworn 
  thousand times    years' space; 
      affects  born, 
    master'd   special grace: 
   break faith,  word  speak  me;
