sonnet isonnet ifrom fairest creatures  desire increase,
  beauty's rose   die,
   riper   time decease,
 tender heir  bear  memory:
 thou, contracted  thine  bright eyes,
feed'st thy light'st flame  self-substantial fuel,
making a famine  abundance lies,
thyself thy foe,  thy sweet   cruel.
thou  art   world's fresh ornament
  herald   gaudy spring,
 thine  bud buriest thy content
and, tender churl, makest waste  niggarding.
pity  world,    glutton be,
 eat  world's due,   grave  thee.
