sonnet xviisonnet xviiwho    verse  time  come,
   fill'd    high deserts?
 yet, heaven knows,     a tomb
 hides  life  shows    parts.
   write  beauty   eyes
  fresh numbers number   graces,
 age     ' poet lies:
 heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'
   papers yellow'd   age
 scorn'd   men   truth  tongue,
  true rights  term'd a poet's rage
 stretched metre   antique song:
   child   alive  time,
  live twice;      rhyme.
