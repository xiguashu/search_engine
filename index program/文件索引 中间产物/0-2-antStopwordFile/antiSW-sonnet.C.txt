sonnet csonnet cwhere art thou, muse,  thou forget'st  long
 speak     thee  thy might?
spend'st thou thy fury   worthless song,
darkening thy power  lend base subjects light?
return, forgetful muse,  straight redeem
 gentle numbers time  idly spent;
sing   ear  doth thy lays esteem
  thy pen  skill  argument.
rise, resty muse,  love's sweet face survey,
 time   wrinkle graven there;
 any,  a satire  decay,
  time's spoils despised  where.
give  love fame faster  time wastes life;
 thou prevent'st  scythe  crooked knife.
